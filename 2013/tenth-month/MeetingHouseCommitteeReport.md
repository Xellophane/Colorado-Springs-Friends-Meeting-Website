## Meeting House Committee

October 10, 2013

Attendance: [Ann Daugherty][AnnDaugherty], clerk; [Daniel Kidney][DanielKidney] and [Molly Wingate][MollyWingate]

Approved minutes from September

Old Business:

a.  We reviewed the original building inspection and found that we had fixed or 
    replaced everything found lacking except the drainage from the back patio area. 
    It still angles toward the building. We paused to celebrate the progress made on 
    our little building and the prudent use of the Meeting’s resources.

b.  Molly is waiting for building costs for an addition to the building and putting a 
    handicapped ramp to the front door. 

c.  Ann Daugherty is working on procuring a clear plastic brochure box to put in 
    front of the meeting house.

d.  Landscaping: We need to finish the landscaping projects begun this summer. The 
    next workday is October 27th

New Business:

a.  We are creating a fall inspection list.

b.  The furnace is scheduled for annual cleaning and check because of our flood.

c.  We are not sure what the source was for the clean water that flooded the 
    basement. We will continue to investigate. In the mean time, we will cut open 
    the damaged drywall to check for mold and to dry it out. Then we will have it 
    repaired. 

d.  Molly will look into a room screen to block cold air coming in from the back door 
    during worship.

e.  Daniel is looking into a 9' X 2-1/2' storage cupboard that Colorado College no 
    longer wants. He will repair as needed and bring it to the Meeting House. 

f.  Discussed the situation of a group that would like to use the meetinghouse 
    once a week on Thursday mornings from 10-11 AM. It is a very small group of 
    Alcoholics Anonymous that can’t afford $40 a month. We thought that it would 
    be okay to start out this rental with the understanding that they give at least $20 a 
    month to cover utilities. In a year, we would revisit the rent.

g.  We checked that the electric heaters in the bathrooms and storage area were 
    working.

h.  Noted that we may need to increase the wattage of the ceiling lights or get some 
    floor lamps for evening events in the winter.


Work Day Projects:

    1.  Mow the front bed and the yard (or use a weed eater)

    1.  Finish the landscaping projects ( weed and mulch front bed, place cobblestones)

    1.  Sweep and mop the meetinghouse floor

    1.  Vacuum and dust.

Respectfully submitted,
