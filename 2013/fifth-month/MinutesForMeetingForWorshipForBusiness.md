# Meeting for Worship with a Concern for Business
Colorado Springs Quaker Meeting
May 19, 2013
 
1. Silence followed by a reading.

2. Consideration of April Minutes

3. Clerk’s Report: 

   Friends, we continue to have a cash flow problem. We have an average monthly
   need of $1,170 and an average monthly income of $888, which is up $185 from 
   last month. In reserve, we have 6 months of expenses related to the building, 
   and less than 1 month of expenses related to the work of the meeting. Our 
   goal is to keep 6 months reserve on hand at all times. We also have about 
   $3,605 that is designated specifically for building projects and nearly $500 
   designated for emergencies as determined by Ministry and Oversight. The 
   upshot is that we have money in the bank, but we are depleting our reserves. 
   Many thanks to Finance Committee for keeping us fiscally aware.
 
   Many thanks to everyone for making the Colorado Regional Meeting Spring 
   Gathering a success. Thanks especially to those who cleaned before and after 
   the event, brought tables and tablecloths,  and brought extra food.  Our 
   guests were very happy to enjoy our new home.
