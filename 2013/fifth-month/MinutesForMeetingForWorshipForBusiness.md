Present: [Molly Wingate][MollyWingate], [Cameron Stoy], Dedeen Candrell, Nancy Andrews, Carlton Gamer, Jeremy Nelson
[Bill Werling][BillWerling], Genie Durland, Bill Durland, two visitors

1. Silence followed by a reading for the Boulder Meeting of Friends's 
   Newsletter, *Miscellany*. 

   From Howard Brinton quote,
   For Friends the most important consideration is not the right action in itself, bu a right inward
   state out of which right action will arise. Given the right inward state, right action is inevitable.
   Inward state and outward action are component parts of a single whole.

2. Consideration of April Minutes, approved

3. Clerkâ€™s Report: Friends, we continue to have a cash flow problem. We have an 
   average monthly need of $1,170 and an average monthly income of $888, which 
   is up $185 from last month. In reserve, we have 6 months of expenses related 
   to the building, and less than 1 month of expenses related to the work of the 
   meeting. Our goal is to keep 6 months reserve on hand at all times. We also 
   have about $3,605 that is designated specifically for building projects and 
   nearly $500 designated for emergencies as determined by Ministry and Oversight. 
   The upshot is that we have money in the bank, but we are depleting our reserves. 
   Many thanks to Finance Committee for keeping us fiscally aware.

   Many thanks to everyone for making the Colorado Regional Meeting Spring Gathering 
   a success. Thanks especially to those who cleaned before and after the event, 
   brought tables and tablecloths,  and brought extra food.  Our guests were very 
   happy to enjoy our new home.
