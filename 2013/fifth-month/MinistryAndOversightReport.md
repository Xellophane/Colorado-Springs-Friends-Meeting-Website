Ministry and Oversight, April 22, 2013

Present: Peter LeVar, Linda Seger, Martha Lutz, Carlton Gamer, Ann Grant Martin - Clerk

We opened about 3:00 with a review of an updated version of our Meeting's Contact List. 
Once everyone had arrived we began with Spiritual Silence.
The first item on our agenda was regarding our member, Jonathan McPhee who is incarcerated 
in the El Paso County Jail. He is struggling with the loss of his freedom and lack of 
resolution regarding his sentencing. He cannot be released until his has been sentenced.

Martha will contact Ann Daugherty about her thoughts regarding putting a brochure box 
outside our Meeting House. Genie Durland is also interested in this project.

Ann Martin has volunteered to teach First Day on the First, First Day of the month. She 
led the children in several traditional Quaker songs in April, but some Friends in 
Meeting for Worship found that the music distracting. Ann will lead fewer songs more quietly 
and without guitar in May and will query Friends about sound disturbance.  We had a lengthy 
conversation about the possibility of sound proofing the First Day room with various materials. 

One remedy of immediate interest is to patch the hole left by a removed air duct. We will 
make a request that it be repaired.
Ann Martin has been in touch with Val Phillips near Gardner. She wishes to have a Worship 
Group under the care of our Meeting at the Shii Koeii intentional community. Val is going to pursue 
having her membership at Mountain View Friends Meeting transferred to our Meeting.  

We discussed making Friendly calls to regular Attenders and Members. It was decided to send an email 
to our Meeting's email list and invite Friends to contact any member of M&O if they have questions, 
concerns and/or personal Spiritual needs. Martha Lutz will craft that email. We will revisit in June 
how best to make more personal contact with our Attenders and Members.

Several of us will personally contact Friends whom we haven't seen lately. Ann Martin will ask others 
about their wishes concerning being listed in our Quaker directory.

In the Light,      

Ann Grant Martin, 

Clerk of Ministry and Oversight
