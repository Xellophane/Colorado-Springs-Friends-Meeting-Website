    e. Thank you to Maria Melendez for finding the chairs and persevering to buy them. 

3. Cash Flow Reports, Sarah reported on cash flow starting balacne in ENT Credit.. 
   (see attached cash flow report). Bank balance is now $795.00. Transfers made from savings
   and checking reserves.  Total savings $6,8868.48 and Total building funds is $8,440.25.

4. Committee Reports:

    a. Finance Committee – Sarah read the Finance Committee Minutes, Finance committee begs that
       that Friends consider their usage of the utilities. Some parts we do have control and 
       every effort made to control the costs.

       Sarah went over the "A Very Basic Cash Flow" revised the Shorten the cash flows. Sarah 
       explained some of the revision from the original. We come up about $50.00 a month short
       on average and it being back-filled with reserves but is not sustain. Reserve will only
       last for the next couple of months at the current. Consider cash flows very carefully
       on the implications to fund the various assessments and suggest donations, fund 
       programs and other organizations, including scholarships to IMYM, websites, and other
       expenses. 

       Molly doesn't think it so bad that we are only $50.00 a month short, conscious of the 
       shortfall but to function up to $50.00, Sarah said we need more to continue. Estimated
       than less than 10%. Namoni asked about the costs sent to external organizations, 
       IMYM is . Bill part of the value to our overall Quaker experiences. Question about 
       what suggestions for improving the budget by increasing revenue.   

       The Finance report was accepted.  

       i. Ad hoc Fund Raising Committee. With Sarah's help Moll will be mailing a letter
          out to past donors to the Meeting.

    b. Nominating Committee 

       Genie and Bill, included Steward Position and guidelines, includes a master of 
       copy of the calendar including the renting or providing space for prospective 
       users of the space and that the organization follows Quaker's values. Steward 
       would rent space. People have already asked about renting space. If this 
       position was accepted the steward would coordinate. Need to find someone to 
       do and writing down the description. Meeting Steward, Peter La Var was the 
       calendar keeper, a Steward has a broader responsibilities and oversee groups
       to use the building. Meeting House Committee already takes up many of the 
       duties of a Steward Position. Calendar keeper would have some Steward 
       Positions and know that the Meeting Committee. 

       Carlton asked if this position needed to live near? Molly responded not 
       necessarily. Namoni asked about breaking up the position to just monthly. It 
       will happen.

       Any ideas about how much to rent for? Molly suggested not more than $20.00 
       an hour. Suggested donations from non-profits, many 12-steps programs meet 
       once-a-month. Meeting Home Committee and Finance Committee meet with new
       Calendaring position. 

       Lisa asked if the Calendaring position would need to attend the outside 
       group event? No, especially if a group is regular user of space. 

    c. Ministry and Oversight 

       Molly was happy to notice about an evening Meeting for Worship once a 
       month. Molly wants to encourage meeting to continue forward. Worship 
       sharing about the doing this Wednesday, March 20th. Different than 
       a Meeting for Worship focused around a couple of different topics, 
       Peace Testimony or personal stewardship of natural resources. Friends agreed
       that a worship sharing on March 20th. Some prefers on the topic? Stewardship
       in our daily lives was suggested to M&O.

       Any suggestions for a monthy evening Meeting for Worship. Asked 6-7pm or 7-8pm?
