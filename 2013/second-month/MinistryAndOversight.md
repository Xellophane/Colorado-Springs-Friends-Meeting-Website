January 28, 2013
313 N. Sheridan Ave., WisDome
Attending Carlton Gamer, Martha Lutz, Ann Grant Martin

Members of M&O include: Carlton Gamer, Peter LeVar, Martha Lutz, 
Ann Grant Martin, and Linda Seger.

After opening with a period of spiritual silence and a check-in, Ann gave a 
report about Jonathan McPhee . Jonathan is doing well at the El Paso County 
Criminal Justice System jail. Various members of the Meeting visit him 
regularly. He deeply appreciates letters, visits and donations to his account.

We continued the discussion of having information cards on each chair for visitors. 
We will place the Poster’s statement on Quakerism on one side. On the other side 
there will be brief information about Meeting for Worship and our traditions 
regarding speaking during Meeting.

We will explore the possibility of placing a plastic box containing Meeting brochures 
outside our Meeting House. We will contact Ann Daugherty to get her suggestions 
about obtaining such a box and posting it.

We encourage the Meeting for Business to explore the possibility of having 
Meeting for Worship in the evening once a month.

We recommend that our Meeting have a Worship Sharing on March 20, 2013, Wednesday 
evening from 6:30 – 8:00. Hot beverages can be available.

Suggested topics include: 

#. How do we practice the Peace Testimony in our daily lives?  .ie., gun control.
#. How do we practice Stewardship in our daily lives?  ..ie,  use of non-renewable materials like oil.

We ask Friends at Business Meeting to recommend either of these topics, or one of their choosing.

We will begin calling members and attenders in March.

Our next meeting will be February 25, 2013 at 313 N. Sheridan in the WisDome at 3:00.

Our meeting closed in spiritual silence.
