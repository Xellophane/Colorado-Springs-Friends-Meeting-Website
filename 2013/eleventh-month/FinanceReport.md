# MINUTES OF FINANCE MEETING
## November 6, 2013

The Finance Committee met on November 6, 2013.

Present were [Sarah Callbeck][SarahCallbeck], Clerk, [Anne Daugherty] and [Julia Roten-Valdez][JuliaRoten-Valdez].

Cash Flow Report:  We are running in the black and stabilizing our income over 
the last five (5) months.  [Sarah][SarahCallbeck] will start billing the meeting 
for her accounting services on a monthly basis to more evenly distribute the impact 
to cash flow.  The $75.00 donation not used by Vicki Aldrich was placed in a war 
tax resistance account for our meeting.  [Daniel][DanielKidney] is regularly monitoring 
the utility usage of the meeting house, which will help ensure that lights or heat are 
not inadvertently left on.

Disbursements:  We have $165.91 at the beginning of November after all of November 
expenses are paid and before the November contributions are received.  The Finance 
Committee recommends $100.00, at a minimum, for disbursements in December.

Miscellaneous Matters:  A letter from the IMYM Treasurer requested remittance of 
assessments for 2013.  However, we will await the count for the Colorado Springs 
monthly meeting from M&O indicating the number of adult members in our meeting 
on January 1, 2014.  We usually pay IMYM assessments in April.  We can pay them 
earlier but will not do so prior to the membership count.

[Anne Daughtery][AnneDaugherty] will call the insurance company to ask if our rates 
will remain stable in spite of the flooding this year.  She will also research any 
annual report filing, with attendant fee, required to maintain our exempt property status.

The pledge mailing request went out November 5, 2013.

Advertising:  We received the renewal notice from DEX for advertising in the Yellow Pages.  
The cost is increasing to $32.00 per month.  Our understanding is [Molly][MollyWingate] 
rarely gets a call from the Yellow Pages; people usually find us on the internet.  We 
investigated the cost of a separate phone line with voicemail; that cost would be 
approximately $35.00 per month.  The Finance Committee made an administrative decision 
to discontinue DEX advertising as the cost seems a poor use of resources compared to the 
response rate.  We will have time to discuss establishing a separate phone line through the 
business meeting process.  This decision had to be timely to meet DEX's advertising deadline.

Budget:  Currently the Meeting's budget includes the essential monthly costs which are shaded.  
It does not include miscellaneous costs which are unshaded, nor donations to other organizations, 
library subscriptions, travel expense, landscaping and repair and maintenance.  The preliminary 
budget will be presented to the business meeting in November and the final budget will be 
presented in December.

Respectfully submitted,

[Julia Roten-Valdez][JuliaRoten-Valdez]
Recording Clerk for the Finance Committee
