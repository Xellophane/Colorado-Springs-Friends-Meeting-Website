    A.  Finance Committee: Cash Flow Report and other financial reports
        Review of Minutes from Committee Meeting. Friends are encouraged 
        to read the Cash Flow report for specifics on the May. May started
        with a lot of cash but the Meeting paid for travel of Quetzal and 
        Caliope.

        [Sarah][SarahCallbeck] Likes to start with at least 600.00 a month to cover basic 
        Meeting expenses. We started May with $5,000 in the building fund but after
        insulation and fans the net cash left over the Building is around 800.00 
        in the Building Fund. [Molly][MollyWingate] asked if we have a six month
        reserve, [Sarah][SarahCallbeck] said we did but barely. [Sarah][SarahCallbeck] 
        showed the decreasing utilities bill due to less gas for the furnace. 
        
        Good news that we did receive are exemption to local taxes from El 
        Paso County as a religious. 

        The cash flow was accepted. Finance Committee didn't meet, will meet 
        next month. [Molly][MollyWingate] asked if we could drop our Dex as most inquires are
        coming from individuals finding information about the Meeting are 
        from online. [Sarah][SarahCallbeck] mentioned that the next opportunity will be at the
        beginning   
       
    B.  Meetinghouse Committee:  Review of Minutes from Committee Meeting
        Insulation completed electricity and the fans implements. Use of the building
        by other groups is recommend by the Meeting house committee, the suggest 
        donation for use by these other groups so to avoid
        any problems with sales tax.

        House cleaning will be on June 30th.

        planted and barely surviving with, whacked back the weeds. If anyone has a lawn 
        mower and a weed whacker to cut down the weeds on the 
        First, thing is a landscape plan and then set-up the watering or sprinkler.
        Russian Sage. We do have a watering system and then plant around and see if 
        automatic watering, we have the sprinklers and piping. System we have is 
        antiquated.
