# STATE OF THE MEETING 
## Colorado Regional, April 24, 2013

The Colorado Springs Religious Society of Friends continues to prosper in the 
search for the Truth. After more than 50 years as a Meeting, we moved into our
Meeting House in May, 2012. We remain of modest size but continue to slowly 
grow and contribute to the greater Quaker community.                                                                                                                                                         
Presently we have 19 Members, about 30 Attenders and 9 junior members and/or 
attenders. We have had 13 visitors sign our guest book during 2012. We have had
one death of an Attender.

Our ailing First Day School has dwindled to the inconsistent attendance of two 
or three students. Our Education Committee has shrunk to one member who asks 
the Meeting for a more lively participation of Friends. At this time First Day
 School is not always offered or needed. 

We have several Members and Attenders who are experiencing serious health 
problems and one who is incarcerated. Friends are aware of the needs of these
people and seek to speak to their condition.

In October, we hosted a community open house. Christmas Eve we had Meeting for
Worship after which we enjoyed singing Carols together. We gathered for a 
"Show and Tell" evening where several Friends talked about what they do in 
their profession or hobby. It was an excellent opportunity to discover the 
unique gift's of Colorado Springs Friends. In March we gathered for Worship 
Sharing. The topic was "How do we practice Stewardship in our daily lives." 
We have a thriving adult Quaker Education program and monthly "work days". 
Several of our Members and Attenders participate on committees that serve 
the greater Quaker community. We support the social justice callings of our 
members and have minuted our support for repealing the death penalty in 
Colorado.

Though we have challenges, the Colorado Springs Quakers benefit from the many 
talents and contributions of Friends. We look forward to continued growth and 
Spiritual Light in the coming year.
