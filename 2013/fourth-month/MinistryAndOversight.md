Ministry and Oversight Minutes: March 25, 2013

313 N. Sheridan Ave. 3:00 PM. Present were [Peter LeVar][PeterLeVar], 
[Carlton Gamer][CarltonGamer], [Martha Lutz][MarthaLutz] and 
[Ann Grant Martin][AnnMartin], Clerk

We opened with Spiritual Silence and then each gave a short "check-in".

We heard from [Ann Martin][AnnMartin] about her visits with 
[Jonathan McPhee][JonathanMcPhee] who is incarcerated at the county jail.  
Ginger Morgan plans to visit Colorado Springs during the last week of June. 
She hopes to come to Meeting on June 23rd. [Julie Roten-Valdez][JulieRoten-Valdez] 
is happily serving on the Finance Committee. [Martha Lutz][MarthaLutz] will 
continue to pursue plans for putting a brochure box in front of our Meeting House.

Because of gathering information for the State of the Meeting Report, we determined 
that we have a total on 19 members. Since our Quaker contact list hasn't been 
revised in several months M&O will begin bringing that list up to date.

Members of the Ministry and Oversight Committee approved the State of the Meeting 
Report as written. 

We had a long conversation about the state of our First Day School. We are 
grateful to [John Gallagher][JohnGallagher] for his First Day School report. Our 
First Day School is in decline and faltering. We are aware of the problems and 
will work with John to see how best the Meeting can support him and serve our Young Friends.

[Martha Lutz][MarthaLutz] continues to see how much interest there is in holding an 
evening Meeting for Worship.

Our evening of Worship Sharing was spiritually rewarding. There were five Friends in 
attendance.

After a period of Spiritual Silence we concluded March's M&O Meeting at about 
4:45.

In the Light,       

[Ann Grant Martin][AnnMartin], 

Clerk of Ministry and Oversight Committee
