4.  Committee Reports:

    1.  *Finance Committee*: Cash Flow Report and other financial reports

    1.  *Ministry and Oversight* Committee: Review of Minutes from Committee Meeting

    1.  *First Day School*: no report

    1.  *Adult Education and Action Committee*:

        [Bill][BillDurland] and [Genie Durland][GenieDurland] have cancelled this fall’s Adult Religious 
        Education due to a lack of interest. It was scheduled to start on 
        September 23rd and was to discuss modern Quakerism.  Only two people 
        confirmed they wanted to attend.

        The occasional book group will read Margaret Bacon's The Back Bench.  
        Let [Molly][MollyWingate] know if you want a copy.  The hope is for an 
        intergenerational discussion some evening with snacks.
         
    1.  *Nominating Committee*:

        Meeting members should be aware that as of January, our Meeting 
        will need a new Clerk and a new Recording Clerk. These are two 
        very important jobs and need to be thoughtfully and prayerfully 
        filled. We are such a small meeting that it seems that this kind of 
        most important service is rotated among just a few dedicated Friends. 
        Nominating Committee has no strong leading at this time, to approach 
        any particular member or attender about his or her interest or calling 
        to fill one of these posts. Therefore we are posting this notice on the 
        bulletin board and asking recording clerk to circulate it as a reminder 
        throughout the meeting each month between now and December.
 
        [Nancy Andrew][NancyAndrew] is the new Librarian

        [Genie Durland][GenieDurland] is Meeting representative to 
        Representative Committee
 
        In addition to the posts named above, Yearly Meeting is continuing to 
        ask us to appoint someone to IMYM Nominating Committee
 
    1.  *Library*: no report

    1.  *Meetinghouse Committee*:  review report

5.  Old Business:

    1.  Landscaping project continuation.  What else do we need?
                
6.  New Business:

    A minute from Boulder Meeting on Syria for us to consider:

    On September 8th, 2013, the Boulder Meeting of the Religious Society
    of Friends (Quakers) approved the following minute:

        "As Quakers, we oppose any military action throughout the world and at 
        this time, we wish to emphasize our opposition to US military action 
        in Syria.

        Military action by the US and other foreign countries will not stop the 
        killing in Syria or bring those responsible for the use of chemical 
        weapons to justice.

        Only international organizations such as the United Nations and the 
        International Criminal Court are likely to be effective in establishing
        a negotiated peace agreement in Syria.

        Diplomatic engagement with all regional stakeholders is what is called 
        for right now.
 
        We encourage the US and other nations to commit their resources to 
        relieve the suffering of the millions of refugees who have found it 
        necessary to flee their homes in Syria"
 
    We are sending this minute to President Obama, Colorado Senators Bennett 
    and Udall, and our congressman, and also urge them to eschew military action
    in Syria, and instead to support diplomatic efforts toward peace. We are 
    also sending the minute to the Boulder Daily Camera and Denver Post. These 
    letters to the editor include the line 
    
        "For further information, please contact the Friends Committee for 
        National Legislation at http://fcnl.org."
                      
7.  Announcements:

    Colorado Regional Meeting at YMCA of the Rockies, October 18-20.  
    Registration deadline was September 13 (Friday).
    
    October 6th for potluck we will have a program about the Summer of Quaking 
    by [Calliope][CalliopeGallagher] and [Queztal Gallagher][QueztalGallagher].  They will talk about the various Quaker 
    programs they participated in and what they gained, thanks in part to the 
    Meeting's support.

    Please put events at the meetinghouse on the paper calendar on the bulletin
    board and let [Molly Wingate][MollyWingate] and [Bill Werling][BillWerling] 
    know.  [Molly][MollyWingate] will get the word 
    out, and Bill is the calendar keeper for now.  He is looking into using Google Calendar.
    If you are part of a group or know of a group who would like to use the meeting house, 
    please have them contact [Bill Werling][BillWerling] at william.werling@gmail.com.
