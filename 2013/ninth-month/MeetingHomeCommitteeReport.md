    1.  Landscaping: 

        Sunday August 25, 2013 brought many members and attenders together to 
        devote time, skill, labor and sweat to our blossoming landscaping efforts.
        [Lisa Lister][LisaLister] and Phil Friesen donated three Lilac plants and 
        mulch; they also brought landscaping materials, shovel, hose and an 
        outpouring of labor.

        [Barbara Bowen][BarbaraBowen] and [Ann Martin][AnnMartinGrant] dug, 
        pulled weeds, and planted donated flowers. [Nancy Andrew][NancyAndrew] 
        and [Martha Lutz][MarthaLutz] tirelessly dug up weeds along the East side 
        to make "ready" for the Lilacs. [Jonathan McPhee][JonathanMcPhee] 
        whipped the wheelbarrow around to rearrange dirt and add mulch and added 
        with the laying of the landscaping cloth. Thank you all. More happened on 
        Sunday, September 7th when we got more river rocks.

    1.  Sprinkler System:

        We will water by hose the remaining of this year. Our decision is that 
        our system will require the assistance of a professional. We would also 
        like to have an outside hose connection.
