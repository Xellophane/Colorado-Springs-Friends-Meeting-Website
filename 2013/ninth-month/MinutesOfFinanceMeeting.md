Cash Flow Report:  We were able to pay two (2) scholarships outside of normal

transfer money to reserve accounts for the payment of future expenses.  The 
building reserve fund was increased by $87.50 to $2,375.31.  Mortgage payments 
are and will be stable until we hit the five-year mark; at that time we will have
a big balloon payment due in approximately March of 2017.  Ann reported that 
[Molly][MollyWingate] is in contact with FGC regarding a replacement for our 
current loan.

Travel assistance requests were met for 2013 for Mountain Friends Camp, FGC, 
CRM Fall Gathering and we hold $50.00 in reserve for IMYM Continuing Committee.

Our utility bills are running under budget presently.  The budget amount is 
$180.00; the last utility bill was $108.84, which leaves us with a credit balance 
of over $150.00 at the start of winter.  Water usage was less last month with no 
surcharges incurred in spite of the landscaping and watering.
