# Minutes for Meeting for Worship with a Concern for Business

Colorado Springs Quaker Meeting

December 15, 2013

1.  Silence followed by a reading.

2.  Consideration of November Minutes

3.  Clerk's Report:  The meeting seems to be in good shape in terms of 
    the physical building, our finances, and people doing service on its 
    behalf. I look forward to stepping down from being the clerk to focus more
    on the spiritual and worship aspects of my faith and to be of service to 
    the meeting and the wider Quaker committee.  It has been an honor and a 
    pleasure to be clerk.  I wish to thank [Jeremy Nelson][JeremyNelson], 
    recording clerk, and everyone else who is stepping down from one position 
    and sliding into another (or two).  I pray for wisdom and energy for all 
    new appointees.

    are encouraged to learn about it and schedule time for the powerful workshop 
    Boulder can provide.

    board and let [Molly Wingate][MollyWingate] and [Bill Werling][BillWerling]
