# Meeting Home Committee Meeting
Minutes December 12, 2013

Committee meeting began around 6:20 PM when [Ann Daugherty][AnnDaugherty] 
arrived amidst the painting of the recently repaired drywall by 
[Molly Wingate][MollyWingate] and [Daniel Kidney][DanielKidney].

Items of Old Business still needing to be addressed are the Installation of the 
obtained Brochure Box; getting the furnace  serviced, purchasing furnace filters 
and learning how to install filters and cleaning and freeing the gutters of 
leaves.

The recent snow emphasized the need for a snow shovel. The committee decided to 
purchase a snow shovel and to replace the missing extensions to the downspouts 
with fiberglass or rubber splash guards.

[Daniel][DanielKidney] has been studying our utility usage. Our gas usage for 
the past bill is greater than 50% less than it was for the same period a year 
ago. Our energy saving efforts are succeeding! Our next immediate concern to 
address is the basement (first day school room) windows. [Daniel][DanielKidney] 
will research, get estimates as to how we may best proceed with those.  Our 
electrical usage was greater than last year at this time. Please follow the 
directions for the bathroom heaters as posted. Bill Werling is exploring the 
feasibility of installing insulation in our bathrooms and storage area.

Maintaining the Meeting Home offers many opportunities for members and attenders 
to assist in various ways to build community. A partial list of opportunities 
are the weekly removal of trash and lining the trash container with plastic 
bags, checking the bathrooms to be sure that paper supplies are available 
weekly, bringing 'something'  on which to snack during afterâ€“meeting-socializing
perhaps coordinating with others to divide the opportunity to participate.

Inventorying our supplies and giving a list of needed items to 
[Sarah Callbeck][SarahCallbeck] to restock.

In the last few months the Meeting Home has been used by others.  I have been 
embarrassed that we were unable to put our on our best face.  I believe that we 
need to dust, sweep, vacuum as regularly as we have "potluck" . The fourth 
Sunday is the most practical time to set aside and like the postman, "neither 
rain, nor sleet, nor snow...". More hands will make the load lighter and time 
required less for all.

This fourth Sunday we need to install brochure box clean bathrooms, dust window 
sills, table tops, table footrests, bookcases, sweep floors and vacuum. A bulb 
has blown in the motion light above the rear door. [Daniel][DanielKidney] is 
looking into finding a replacement.

Upon returning the bookcase to its former location, replacing books on its 
shelves, cleaning the paintbrushes and returning the paint to the storage area, 
the meeting adjourned shortly after 8:00 PM.

In the Light,

[Ann Daugherty][AnnDaugherty]

Meeting Home Committee Chairperson
