# NOMINATING COMMITTEE REPORT
Meeting for Worship for Business, December 15, 2013

Attached is the final service position list with terms as of this date.

[Lisa Lister][LisaLister] has graciously and prayerfully agreed to serve the 
Meeting as Presiding Clerk. We will all be most supportive of her efforts. 
All other new volunteers to service positions have been noted at previous 
business meetings. [Lisa Bechrich][LisaBechrich] has expressed an interest in 
serving on Finance Committee. That information has been communicated to 
[Sarah Callbeck][Sarah Callbeck] and we await a decision. [Lisa][LisaBechrich]
also expressed an interest in working with the first day school children and so 
her name has been added to that list. We also await word from 
[John Gallagher][JohnGallagher] as to whether he wishes to continue as First 
Day School Clerk. 

Bill Hobson, Clerk of IMYM Representative Committee has said that the IMYM 
Service Committee is languishing in need of new and active members. 
[Bill Durland][BillDurland] has let him know that he will serve on that 
committee. That nomination will probably be confirmed at the February 
Representative Committee meeting.

In the Light,

[Genie Durland][GenieDurland] and [Bill Werling][BillWerling]
