NOMINATING COMMITTEE REPORT (1/20/2013 
======================================

Nominating Committee is pleased to report the following nominations:

`Lisa Lister`_ agrees to be our new Librarian and `Nancy Andrew`_ expressed an 
interest in being an assistant librarian.

`Julie Roten-Valdez`_ will serve on the Finance Committee, much in need of a 
third member.

`Ann Daugherty`_ has agreed to be our new Treasurer.

Nominating Committee requests the Meetingâ€™s approval of these nominations.

Significant documentation has been received from Yearly Meeting regarding 
structural changes which impact Monthly Meeting appointments to YM positions. 
Briefly this information (attached) describes the replacement of Continuing Committee 
with REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE and the creation of an ARRANGEMENTS COMMITTEE. 
Arrangements Committee is the umbrella organization for Facilities Working Group, 
Youth Working Group and Program Working Group. Each Monthly Meetings is requested to 
appoint a representative to REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE and to IMYM NOMINATING COMMITTEE. 

Nominating Committee believes these changes and necessary appointments are 
substantive enough that our Meeting, as a whole, should be aware of them and understand 
their ramifications for our meeting. We request that Friends read the attached documents 
prior to Meeting for Worship for Business so that a meaningful discussion of these matters 
can take place.

Our current representative to Continuing Committee is `Nancy Andrew`_. She expressed an interest 
in continuing in that role in spite of having to miss the winter meeting last week. She is 
considering the attached information in order to gain clarity as to whether she is called to 
the work as it is now being described.

In the Light,

`Genie Durland`_ and `Bill Werling`_
