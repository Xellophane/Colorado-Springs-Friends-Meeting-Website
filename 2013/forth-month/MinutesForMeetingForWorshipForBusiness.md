## Forth Month Meeting for Worship for Business Minutes

Present:

1. Approval of March  Minutes

2. Cash Flow Reports

3. Clerk's report:
   Friends, we have a cash flow problem. We have an average monthly need of 
   $1170 and an average monthly income of $703. In reserve, we have 6 months 
   of expenses related to the building, and just about 4 months of expenses 
   related to the work of the meeting. Our goal is to keep 6 months reserve 
   on hand at all times. We also have about $500 that is designated 
   specifically for building projects and $500 designated for emergencies as 
   determined by Ministry and Oversight. The upshot is that we have money in 
   the bank, but we are depleting our reserves. Many thanks to Finance 
   Committee for keeping us fiscally aware.
