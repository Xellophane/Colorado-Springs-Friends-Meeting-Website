Meeting House Committee  March 13, 2012
=======================================
Attendance:  [Ann Daugherty][AnnDaugherty], clerk; [Molly Wingate][MollyWingate]; 
[Daniel Kidney][DanielKidney]

A variety of projects have been completed around the meeting house at little or 
no cost. The chairs were cleaned up a bit, splash pans were put under the 
downspout in the front bushes and the heater condensation outlet, and a small 
walkway near the back door was installed.

1. Current projects: At the behest of the finance committee, we put off for a 
   month costly projects.  

   *Electrician*:  Ann Daugherty will arrange for the electrician to return to 
   the meeting house this week to do the following, giving us bids along the way:

   *. Inspect wiring in the attic
   *. Install ceiling fans
   *. Install second switch and rheostat for overhead lights, if possible
   *. Advise about the safety of the outside light fixtures
   *. Advise and install motion sensors that are independent of indoor lighting
	
   *Insulate attic*: Once the electrician is finished in the attic,   Molly will 
   arrange for insulation to be put in the attic.  We have a bid of $1,100.

   *Fence on west side of the building*: We had some new thinking about 
   replacing the fence on the west side of building.  We want to put in 
   something that will deter traffic, make is safe for little ones to exit the 
   building through the side door, and will let in light for plantings. Daniel 
   will arrange to haul the old fence away and price 3 inch wooden and chain 
   link fencing.  We anticipate it will be less than $200. He hopes to have the 
   materials ready for the next work day, March 31.

   *Chairs*: We are seeking out economical ways to replace the missing plastic 
   caps.  If desired, we can arrange to paint the metal on the worship area chairs. 

   *Room Screens*:  On hold until finances are secure, and we can find something 
   suitable at a store with business practices the meeting can support.

2. Long Term projects: Replace front doors and sill, paint the exterior trim, build addition.

3. Warm weather workday projects:
	Landscaping/irrigation plan
	Replace the fence
	Open the upper window sashes	
	Paint the side door and back door
	Clean and paint window screens

4. Continuing Needs:
   A fabric cover for an arm chair - something that will be pleasing with the 
   other colors in the room and cover the damaged arms.

   We have an extra area rug rolled up in the basement.  We need it to return 
   to its owner or it is available for whoever would like it.  

   We are looking for Friends who are interested organizing some landscaping 
   activities. We have ideas about planting lilacs along Cedar St. and we have 
   an irrigation system that needs some attention. A budget and a general plan 
   would be helpful.  

   We ask Friends to please make sure that the bathroom doors are completely 
   closed at all times, especially during the winter as they are heated by 
   expensive electric heat.  The thermostat for the bathrooms in located in the 
   men's room on the wall next to the mirror.   Please use the thermostat (not 
   the dials on the individual baseboard heaters) to adjust the temperature, 
   but return it to 55 when no longer using the building.  


In the Light,

Molly Wingate
Secretary
