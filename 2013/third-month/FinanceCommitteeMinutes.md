Finance Committee Minutes
=========================
March 5 & 7, 2013

Present: [Sarah Callbeck][SarahCallbeck] (clerk) and [Julie Roten-Valdez][JulieRotenValdez] at 
Julie’s office, then [Sarah][SarahCallbeck] and [Ann Daugherty][AnnDaugherty] (treasurer) 
by telephone.  

After opening in silence, we took up a priority issue with Calvert.  
Until February, we have had sufficient funds in our Calvert account 
that their minimum balance requirement of $2,000 was not a concern.  
That has now changed: we were charged a minimum balance fee of $3.00.  
As we are unable to bring the balance up to the minimum now or in the 
foreseeable future, the Finance Committee decided the best course of 
action was to close the account, thus avoiding a slow erosion of our 
funds.  A redemption request has been submitted to Calvert and will 
take effect on Monday, March 18th.  Once the check is received from 
them, it will be deposited into our ENT Savings account for mortgage 
reserve as part of our prudent reserve.  

We reviewed a "Calculation of Funds Available for Disbursement Monthly", 
prepared to facilitate committee discussion and analyze the effect of 
anticipated revenue and expenses on cash flow prior to paying bills.  

This is the month in which IMYM scholarships are disbursed.  A sum of $875 
has been budgeted for this and for travel assistance to Continuing Committee, 
but current cash flow is insufficient to support it.  The Finance Committee 
proposes reducing IMYM scholarships to $50/adult and $25/child.  A special 
donation in support of scholarships has been made, and this, along with an 
additional $125, would cover the number of Friends (5 adults, 4 children) who 
requested assistance last year.  Currently, there is $155 more in assessment 
reserves than is needed to pay this year’s assessments.  **Would the Meeting 
approve using this excess for scholarships as an appropriate use of funds, or 
should it be kept in reserve for next year?**

Also budgeted for this month is $100 for disbursements to national organizations 
and a $100 donation for camperships pledged last year to Mountain Friends Camp.  
We would like to fulfill the pledge as soon as we can, but may not be able to do 
it this month.  Disbursements were begun when the Meeting had excess cash.  **If we 
do not have any excess cash, should we forgo disbursements to other organizations 
until our checking account again carries a balance that can sustain them?**

We then discussed assessments.  The Finance Committee feels the assessment contributions 
to IMYM and Colorado Regional are an obligation of the Meeting.  IMYM Faith and Practice 
states: "Intermountain Yearly Meeting’s annual assessment [which supports general 
operations (p. 71)] is a contribution from each of its affiliated monthly meetings of a 
per capita amount based on the number of adult members reported by the monthly meeting 
in its most recent census.  ... payment of which is the responsibility of the monthly meetings." 
(p. 72)  No mention is made as to whether payment of the assessment is voluntary, unless that 
meaning is taken as implied in the word "contribution".  **Does the Meeting consider the payment 
of assessments to be voluntary or an obligation?  When assessments are paid, should we pay for 
all members or should we pay only for those members who make a contribution either by pledge or 
specifically for their assessment portion?**

It was noted there are members who have moved away or have not attended in a long time.  The 
Finance Committee requests that M&O, in the course of their annual contact with these members, 
inquire if they wish to remain on the Meeting’s roster.

We briefly reviewed the cash flow report, noting that the checking account balance is at $622.61, 
a decline, but that, happily, the utility bill also declined by a little over $75.  Further 
utilities bill decline is anticipated as the weather warms.

No word has been received from the State, yet, about the status of our religious exemption 
application.  Ann will follow up with a phone call on Monday, March 18th.

In the Light,
[Sarah Callbeck]
