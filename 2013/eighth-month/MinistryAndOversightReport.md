Ministry and Oversight Committee, July 22, 2013

Present in attendance: Linda Seger, Carlton Gamer, Martha Lutz, Peter LeVar. Ann Grant Martin was with her gravely ill father. Peter LeVar stepped in without hesitation to clerk the meeting. 

The brief and informal itemized Agenda Ann Martin forwarded focused on the following subjects: Sherry MacMahon, Kathy Ide, Jonathan McPhee, and the question as to whether attendees and Members of our Colorado Springs Meeting, who are attend infrequently should be contacted first rather than members and attenders who come regularly  

Those present opened with Spiritual Silence and then commenced to address how best to minister to Sherry MacMahon. Peter had already contacted her. She reported that she was doing well and that her house was spared in the Black forest fire. Her son contacts her frequently and as needed. She would like our current directory to be mailed to her.

Peter attempted to phone Kathy Ide without success. Previously Kathy had 
explicitly noted that she enjoyed conversations with Peter that dealt with 
the essential issues of life, dying and the attendant feelings. Kathy's phone 
number will be confirmed.
 
As per letters from Jonathan McPhee, Peter and Linda expected him to be released from the El Paso County Jail on August 1, 2013. He was hoping to find housing with his friend, Eric. If not, his former employer, Joan Norris has offered him a residence. Ann Martin also procured an application for housing with the Ithaca Land Trust.
 
Martha spoke about her relations with Pam Hazelton.  She noted that this relationship  had come to an end.  Martha noted she gained in positive ways from her association with Pam.
 
Peter offered to begin phoning names in the Colorado Springs Meeting Directory who attended infrequently. No decision was made as to which people would be called or how to divide up the list. This issue can be resolved at our next M&O Meeting.
 
No date was set for the next Meeting for M&O. The 4th Monday of August was suggested since Linda will be traveling on the 3rd Monday of August.
 
The meeting closed in silence.
 
In the Light,
 
Peter LeVar
