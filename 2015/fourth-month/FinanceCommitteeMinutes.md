## Finance Committee Meeting

[LisaLister]: /Friends/LisaLister
[SarahCallbeck]: /Friends/SarahCallbeck


April 7, 2015

Present: [Sarah Callbeck][SarahCallbeck] (Bookkeeper, Treasurer, & Clerk) and 
[Lisa Lister][LisaLister] (Recorder)


We carefully reviewed all financial reports for the period ending
3-31-2015:

-   Cash Flow Report and Bank Balance

-   Ent Savings Detail Update

-   Calculation of Funds Available for Disbursement

-   Travel Assistance Requests spreadsheet

    -   Because of reduced budget this year, the meeting is able to
        offer assistance for IMYM at the rate of $83 per adult and $42
        per child.

    -   If you are planning to ask for assistance for any Friends
        gathering (IMYM or other), please let [Sarah][SarahCallbeck] know soon, so she
        can plan appropriately.

The utility bill was not available at the time of our meeting. However,
Colorado Springs Utilities is instituting an electric cost adjustment as
of the beginning of April which will reduce cost for commercial
customers by $7.20 per month.

The Treasurer continues to set reserves aside for anticipated costs of
mortgage, utilities, insurance, website hosting, assessments and a
prudent reserve which means we are prepared in the case of a fiscal
emergency and have funds available when these large expenses come due.

Detective Bramwell of the CSPD Fraud Unit called to say our check thief
had been caught " in possession of the rest of our stolen checks " and
has been arrested and jailed.

Letters to members regarding IMYM and regional assessment costs will be
mailed soon.

We closed in silence.

[Lisa][LisaLister]
