        reference to the individual that was arrested for stealing the
        blank checks from the front porch of the meeting. [Bill Durland][BillDurland]
        proposed the following: **For the sake of restorative justice
        and our own Quaker values, we believe that a personal
        relationship between the defendant and our community is helpful.
        We would ask the court to rely on restitution and community
        service as alternatives to a jail sentence.** It was noted that
        we did not know much information on where this case was in the
