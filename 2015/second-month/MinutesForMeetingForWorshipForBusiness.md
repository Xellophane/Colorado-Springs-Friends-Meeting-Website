1.  Acceptance of minutes: Twelfth month and First month: approved 
2.  Reports
    1.  Ministry and Oversight Committee: Minutes accepted. 
        Quaker Quest was discussed and it is a dynamic and transformative 
        inreach and outreach program that is based on the experience that 
        the Quaker way is a spiritual path for our time that is simple, 
        radical, and contemporary. We will introduce this program to the 
        Meeting as a whole at the March potluck. Email information sent 
        prior to the March potluck will include the FGC website and the 
        Quaker Quest link so that Friends can familiarize themselves. If 
        Friends approve, the consideration of implementing Quaker Quest 
        will go to the next Meeting for Business.
    2.  Meeting House Committee: Verbal report accepted.
 
        Summary:

        1.  $150 was spent on cleaning and repairing the gutters and this will 
            be coordinated with the finance committee for an estimated $175 
            annual expense.
        2.  We continue to look at refinancing the mortgage for the meeting house 
        3.  We are still seeking an estimate for additional electrical outlets 
            in the meeting house.
        4.  There was discussion of bartering work in exchange for use of the 
            meeting house.  This issue was tabled until more information is 
            available.
        5.  After some discussion, the clerk suggested that the Meeting House 
            Committee develop a draft policy for use of the meeting house and 
            it was suggested that it include at least some nominal fee for use.  
            This will serve as a starting place for further discussion about 
            meeting house usage by other groups.  We are hoping to develop a 
            clear policy that can be posted on our website.
        6.  There was also a discussion about the desire to get internet and 
            ability to display presentations (projector or large TV) as a long
