# Finance Committee Meeting
May 5, 2015

Present: [Sarah Callbeck][SarahCallbec] (Bookkeeper, Treasurer, & Clerk), 
[John Robey][JohnRobey] and [Lisa Lister][LisaLister] (Recorder)


We began with silence.

We are pleased to welcome [John Robey][JohnRobey] as a member of the committee.

We carefully reviewed all financial reports for the period ending
4-31-2015, and found all to be in good order:

    -   Cash Flow Report and Bank Balance

    -   Ent Savings Detail Update

    -   Calculation of Funds Available for Disbursement

Because [John][JohnRobey] was new to the committee, [Sarah][SarahCallback] reviewed the duties of the
committee including the committee's calendar of duties, and what
reserves are set aside for anticipated costs of mortgage, utilities,
insurance, website hosting, assessments, a prudent reserve, etc.

The Finance Committee wishes to thank [Lisa Beckrich][LisaBeckrich] for her valued
service to the Finance Committee this past year. Sarah will send Lisa B.
a note of thanks to this effect.

Assessment letters will be distributed in person or by mail in the near
future.

[Lisa L.][LisaLister] will open a P.O. Box at the downtown Post Office under the
meeting's name. The meeting is concerned about recent incidents of
improper mail delivery (letters sticking out, etc.) and think this would
be the best option. [John][JohnRobey] has generously agreed to pay half of the cost.

We closed in silence.

[Lisa][LisaLister]

Recorder
