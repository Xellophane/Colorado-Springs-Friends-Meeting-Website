        NEWS from the clerk of Finance:

        FFC has changed their withdrawal authorization policy to require two
        authorizations instead of just one. The second person must be serving
        as an officer of the meeting (clerk, treasurer, etc.). There is an
        Account Authorization Form, to be kept on file at FFC, and a Withdrawal
        Request Form that must be submitted each time we make a withdrawal.The
        first form needs to be completed and returned to FFC in a timely manner,
        then updated whenever there is a change of officer.

        It appears that we may have this already taken care of because we have
        two names on the bank account.

        **Other Committee reports**

    1.  **First Day School** verbal report encouraging Friends to welcome
        children.

1.  **OTHER**: 

    The meeting received a letter from Ed Ayres (who grew up a
    Friend) who has written a book titled "Dodging Dystopia: Going On with
    the Human Journey After Technology Fails Us." He will email the
    manuscript to anyone interested in reading it and then commenting on why
    this book would be a good choice for Quaker reading or discussion
    groups. [Lisa][LisaLister] has his letter and more information if anyone 
    is interested.
