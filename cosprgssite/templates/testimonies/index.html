<h1>Our testimonies</h1>
<p>Our testimonies grew out of Friends’ experience of the Light of God 
   in private contemplation and in worship together. These testimonies 
   form one of the most powerful expressions of our faith to the world.
</p>
<p>
   We do not hold a specific creed, nor is there a statement of faith to
   which we are asked to subscribe. Instead, we hold a central belief 
   that there is that of God within each person, and that we are called 
   to act in recognition of that Divine presence in ourselves and 
   others. 
</p>
<p>
   The conviction to honor ‘that of God in each one’ can lead to great 
   diversity among Friends. We hold these testimonies in common
