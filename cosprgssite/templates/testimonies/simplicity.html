 <blockquote class="pull-right">
  To Quakers, simplicity is a spiritual quality that denotes an inward 
  centeredness, a singleness of being that is responsive to the Divine 
  within. Simple living is a creative act that frees us from extraneous 
  concerns and enables us to devote attention to the Divine. A simple 
  life is often hard to achieve. It means consuming or collecting nothing 
  in excess of what is needful for our health and well-being and 
  understanding what that is. What is needful may differ from one person 
  to another, but in general it means that which is not extrane- ous in 
  terms of time, possessions, speech, and activities.</p>
