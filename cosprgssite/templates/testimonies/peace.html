   The Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL) fields the 
   largest team of registered peace lobbyists in Washington, DC. Founded
   in 1943 by members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), 
   FCNL's multi-issue advocacy connects historic Quaker testimonies on 
   peace, equality, simplicity, and truth with 
   peace and social justice issues which the United States government 
   is or should be addressing.
