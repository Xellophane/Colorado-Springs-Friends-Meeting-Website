1.  Meeting opened with silence at 11:28 followed by the following reading from 
    Britain Yearly Meeting:   *We do not own the world, and its riches are 
    not ours to dispose of at will.  Show a loving consideration for all 
    creatures, and seek to maintain the beauty and variety of the world.  Work 
    to ensure that our increasing power over nature is used responsibly, with 
    reverence for life.  Rejoice in the splendor of God's continuing creation.*

2.  Acceptance of minutes:

    **Sixth month:** <http://coloradospringsquakers.org/meetings/Business/2014/6>
    approved with corrections

    **Seventh month:** approved with corrections (paper copy), pending being posted 

3.  Committee Reports

    1.  **Ministry and Oversight Committee** - the minutes accepted for both 
        August and September committee meetings.  In the September committee 
        meeting there was discussion about the suitability of asking at the 
        rise of meeting for "messages that did not rise to the level of Meeting 
        for Worship." It was the sense of those present at that Ministry and 
        Oversight Committee Meeting that it would be best to have Messages 
        spoken only during Meeting for Worship.  We thank M&O for their careful 
        and worshipful consideration of this issue.  Details can be found in the 
        M&O Minutes for ninth month.

    2.  **Meeting House Committee** - the minutes accepted for September.  This 
        month during the work day the committee suggests that we: haul the trash 
        out from behind the meetinghouse, mow one more time, perform the usual 
        housekeeping, and maybe repaint the basement floor.

        The problem of the scratched floor under the back table was discussed.  
        The committee will look into getting a rug for under the table, perhaps 
        one to match the larger rug. 

        The committee posed two questions to the Finance Committee: 


        1.  Can we afford $400 to remove the stump?

        2.  Can we afford to bring in an electrician to install additional 
            electrical outlets?

    3.  **Finance Committee** - the minutes and financial reports were accepted 
        with many thanks.  [Sarah Callbeck][SarahCallbeck] indicated that 
        deposits have remained down over the past two to three months.  The 
        Finance Committee will send out pledge letters in October. It was 
        further reported that utility costs have been down. With the $100 we 
        have available for distribution to national organizations, it was 
        determined that $50 would be given to support the efforts of Mike Gray 
        and the other $50 would be donated to the Ramallah Friends School to support 
        their efforts.  

        [Sarah][SarahCallbeck] also indicated there was not currently enough money 
        in the Meeting Home Special Projects fund to support stump removal and 
        that the Meeting Home Committee should pursue a quote for the electrical 
        costs before a determination could be made to see if it can be funded.

        Balances Reported (end of August)


        *   Checking: **$192.50**

        *   Savings: **$7615.77**
                
        *   Building Fund: **$9254.44**
            

    4.  **Library** - The library committee report was given orally by the 
        Librarian, Nancy Andrew.  She is  using LibraryThing.com as the 
        software to organize our library collection. You can now search 
        for books in our collection online (at least the portion of our 
        library collection that has been cataloged). There was discussion 
        about the need to determine what the focus or emphasis will be for the library.  
        It was determined that this will be discussed at the business meeting in 
        November. There was also additional discussion about where to house the 
        collection in the meeting house and the possibility of eventually building 
        permanent bookshelves. 

4.  **Old Business - None were addressed**

5.  **New Business - None were addressed**

6.  **Announcements**

    [Genie][GenieDurland] & [Bill Durland][BillDurland] are teaching a four-part 
    course, "Hope for the Holy Land," to be held Oct. 2, 9, 16 and 23 at High 
    Plains Church, evenings from 6:30-8:30.  ($20 donation suggested).  

    Soup and Sharing at 6 PM Sunday, Nov. 9 at the home of [Lisa Lister][LisaLister] 
    and [Phil Friesen][PhilFriesen]. The plan is to share with each other our 
    thoughts on: Why am I a Quaker/ Why do I come to Meeting, and What has Quakerism 
    contributed to our Community, and other fundamental queries. If those who attend 
    conclude, after this session, that it would be well to offer a two-evening 
    Introduction to Quaker origins, values, processes and practices, delving deeper 
    into who we are, who we were and where we are going, we will do it at a later date. 
    At this point we need expressions of interest.

    At the rise of the meeting on October 5th we will hold a Potluck to say "Goodbye" 
    to [Daniel Kidney][DanielKidney].  Please join us as we wish him well in his journey.

7.  **Meeting was closed with silence at 12:48**
