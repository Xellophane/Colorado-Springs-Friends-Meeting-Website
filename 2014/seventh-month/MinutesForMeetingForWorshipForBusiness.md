2.  Committee reports

    1.  Finance Committee: A finance committee member went over committee meeting 
        notes with emphasis that enough assessment contributions have come in such 
        that only one more reserve amount of $45, in July, is needed to complete 
        the reserve.  The assessment contributions will be moved to the reserve 
        in two transfers of $171 each in July and August.  The Finance Committee 
        proposed that funds no longer needed for this purpose be used to replenish 
        the Emergency Reserve and augment the Travel Reserve, assuming donation 
        income is sufficient.  The acting clerk indicated that it was within the 
        purview of the committee to make this decision. Ending Savings Balance: 
        $7454.89    Ending Checking: $474.11

    2.  Meeting Home: It was reported that the committee is working on improving 
        the downstairs for First Day School and has received a quote to replace 
        windows.  They are also looking into a handicapped ramp and a programmable 
        thermostat.

3.  Old Business: Confirmation was made of the transfer of Helen Knudsen's membership 
    to Wyoming Friends Meeting. The transfer was accepted and minuted at the sixth 
    month Meeting for Worship with a Concern for Business

4.  New Business:

    [Molly][MollyWingate] suggested use of a Yard Sale to help with revenue 
    generation for the meeting and to bring exposure to the meeting house location. 

    The meeting received a letter from the Executive Director of Pendle Hill 
    thanking for the participation and the presence of the Durlands in their 
    community for the Spring term 2014.

    Fall Regional Gathering will be the held the last weekend in October 2014 
    at the Colorado Rockies YMCA
