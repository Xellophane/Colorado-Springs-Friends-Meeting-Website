April 13th, 2014

[LisaLister]: /Friends/LisaLister
[MollyWingate]: /Friends/MollyWingate
[PhilFriesen]: /Friends/PhilFriesen

In attendance:  [Molly Wingate][MollyWingate], [Ann Daugherty][AnnDaugherty] (clerk), 
[Lisa Lister][LisaLister], [Phil Friesen]

1.  We examined the plans for the renovation to the front of the building.  
    [Molly][MollyWingate] will pass our notes on to Bill Barnes and Murphy 
    Constructors.  We look forward to a solid bid soon so that we can apply 
    for a grant from FGC.
    
2.  [Molly][MollyWingate] reported that Frazier Tree Service recommends 
    that we remove the alder tree behind the meetinghouse as it is hollow 
    and will likely keep dropping large limbs.  The fee will be $485.  We 
    approved the expense.  If we want to remove the stump, there will be an 
    additional fee.

3.  Work days have not been well attended lately.  We ask Friends to help with 
    cleaning up the Meeting House on the 4th Sunday of the month. We need 
    people to help out for 20 or 30 minutes. We will also be planning 
    landscaping and other outdoor projects as the weather improves.  

4.  Landscaping projects for the time being will be limited to the Cedar side 
    of the meetinghouse since any construction in the front will probably 
    involve the little yard area along Cimarron.  We hope to complete the 
    mulching project and to install a 3' wide walkway of thick pavers in the 
    sidewalk cut.

5.  [Ann Daugherty][AnnDaugherty] will talk with City Glass about replacing the 
    basement windows with something functional.  She will also schedule
    getting the furnace cleaned.

April work list:

*  Clean bathrooms (sinks, toilets, sweep and mop, trash, paper products, 
   remove curtains to be cleaned) 

*  Sweep and Mop meeting room

*  Vacuum carpeting 

*  Dust everywhere

*  Wash windows and get out the screens

*  Use Murphy Oil Soap to clean and help preserve the wood trim around the doors and windows

In the Light,

[Molly Wingate][MollyWingate]
