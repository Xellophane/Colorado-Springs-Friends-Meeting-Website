Contacted for E - Meeting: [Sarah Callbeck][SarahCallbeck], 
[Ann Daughtery][AnnDaughtery], [Julie Roten Valdez][JulieRotenValdez], and 
[Lisa Beckrich][LisaBeckrich]

1.  **Cash Flow and Checking Balance Report**: The ending bank balance is high
    because funds were moved from the savings account to pay insurance; 
    however, the insurance payment wasn't made until April.

2.  **Calculation of Funds Available (worksheet for current month cash flow)**: 
    If anticipated funds are received and deposited, we will have enough to 
    pay/transfer to savings all the listed items.  

3.  **Travel Requests**: The Finance Committee is in agreement to provide $100 
    per adult and $50 per child for IMYM travel scholarships. This amount is
    supported by special donations for travel totaling $245 and by $90 from the 
    travel reserve. The suggestion to set up a travel reserve as a buffer to 
    to cash flow for the bulk of travel  fund requests received  in the first
    part of the year was agreed upon.

4.  **ENT Savings Detail Update**: Assessment Reserve includes $126 for Colorado		
    Regional Meeting, which needs to be paid in April.

5.  **Utilities**: We are happy to report that the new budget billing amount for April		
    2014 through March 2015 is $131 - a decrease of $49.

6.  **Assessment Letters** will be mailed this month. 

7.  **First Quarter Financial Statements** will be prepared for bookkeeper review to verify
    posting is correct. 

8.  **Checking Account Breach**:  A re-order of checks was apparently left on our doorstep
    rather than being placed in our mailbox. It was stolen, and a fraudulent check was
    presented against our account. [Sarah Callbeck][SarahCallbeck] caught the cashing of the check and
    notified the bank.  The bank closed our account, put a stop on the check and returned
    funds to our account. Harland Clarke, the printer, was then notified, as were the police.
    A new checking account has been opened at ENT, and all check and deposit slip 
    orders are now being delivered to them for pick up by [Sarah Callbeck][SarahCallbeck], rather than to
    the Meetinghouse.
