## April 7, 2014

[AnnGrantMartin]: /Friends/AnnGrantMartin
[CarltonGamer]: /Friends/CarltonGamer
[JeremyNelson]: /Friends/JeremyNelson

Present: [Jeremy Nelson][JeremyNelson], [Carlton Gamer][CarltonGamer] and 
[Ann Grant Martin][AnnGrantMartin] - Clerk

We opened with Spiritual Silence at 3:00 PM in our Quaker Meeting House.

After a brief check-in we had a review of how our Friend who is on parole is 
doing. He is employed as a carpenter for about 30 hours a week. He likes the 
work but has also submitted many applications for truck driving employment. He 
is doing well and will be released from parole on May 1st. He is looking 
forward to attending Meeting for Worship after May 1.

The majority of our meeting was spent creating 2014's State of the Meeting 
report. Though a couple of our programs have declined, there were several events 
of significance that took place at our Meeting House. [Ann][AnnGrantMartin] will 
write the report with [Jeremy][JeremyNelson] and  [Carlton's][CarltonGamer]
corrections and suggestions.

Our next meeting will be May 7th, 3:00 PM at the Meeting House.

In the Light,
[Ann Grant Martin][AnnGrantMartin], 
Clerk of the Ministry and Oversight  Committee
