1.  Opening silence 
    
    Lisa read an advice and query from IMYM Faith and Practice.

    Advice: *The heart of the Religious Society of Friends is the meeting for 
    worship.  It calls us to offer ourselves, body mind and soul, to wait in 
    active anticipation for the revelation of the Spirit.*

    Query: *When in meeting for worship, do I clear my mind so the Spirit has 
    a place to enter?  Do I wait in great expectancy for the Spirit to speak - 
    through me or through another?  Do I put my trust in the still small voice 
    that I may hear?*

APPENDIX A

## STATE OF THE MEETING
Colorado Regional, April 27, 2014

The Colorado Springs Religious Society of Friends continues to prosper in the 
search for the Truth. After more than 50 years as a Meeting, we moved into our 
Meeting House in May, 2012. We remain of modest size but continue to slowly 
grow and contribute to the greater Quaker and Peace communities.                                                                                                                                                         
Presently we have 19 Members, about 8 Attenders and 2 junior members and/or 
attenders. We have had 23 visitors sign our guest book during 2013. We have had 
one death of an Attender.

Except for two Junior Young Friends who live in Pueblo, we seldom have 
children at meeting. However, we do have a well-stocked First Day School room 
and teachers ready to teach. We look forward to the time when we have a more 
vigorous First Day School program. Our adult Religious Education program 
studied the Quaker Testaments.

Our Friend who was incarcerated was released in August and will finish his 
parole on May 1. We look forward to his return to Meeting.

In the past year we have installed ceiling fans and a new furnace. 

Last April we hosted Colorado Regional and an Interfaith meeting, "Historical 
Peace Churches" that focused on Quaker, Mennonite and Brethren traditions. We 
carried on with having another "Show and Tell." Learning about individual 
Friend's professions or hobbies builds a stronger Quaker community. In addition 
to writing many articles and books, Bill Durland has several plays to his 
credit.  Several play rehearsals were held at our Meeting House.   In November, 
a Memorial Service was given for Kathy Ide, a long time Attender of our Meeting. 
On Christmas Eve we had Meeting for Worship after which we enjoyed singing 
Carols together. Friends regularly support our monthly "work days." We have 
begun landscaping our little corner in the neighborhood. Several of our Members 
and Attenders participate on committees that serve the greater Quaker community. 
We support the social justice callings of our members  

Though we have challenges, the Colorado Springs Quakers benefit from the many 
talents and contributions of Friends. We look forward to continued growth and 
Spiritual Light in the coming year.

## Travel Minute for Bill and Genie Durland
19 Third Month, 2014

Dear Friends,

Loving greetings from Friends at Colorado Springs Friends Meeting of 
Intermountain Yearly Meeting.  Our members, Bill and Genie Durland, will be 
serving as Friends in Residence at Pendle Hill during the Spring 2014 term.  

Bill and Genie are spiritual pillars of our small Friends Meeting.  They 
have committed themselves to peace and social justice issues, and their lives 
"speak" eloquently in this regard, inspiring others with both their actions 
and words.  They are each gifted in vocal ministry and share generously 
their intellectual and spiritual gifts.

We entrust Bill and Genie to your care, pleased that they will have the 
opportunity to participate in the life of your community, and certain that your 
community will come to love, respect and embrace Bill and Genie as our meeting has.  

We hold Bill and Genie in our prayers and trust that God will richly bless your 
time together.

Lisa Lister
