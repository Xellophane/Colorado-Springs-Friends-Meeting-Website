Meeting House Committee Minutes 12/14/14

Molly Wingate, Phil Friesen, Ann Daugherty (clerk)

1.  We will move the lock box for the building key so the ladies’ room door will be easier to use.

2. We have been foiled in our efforts to get contractors to even look at our little projects.

3. With the funds that we have, we have prioritized adding electrical outlets to the meeting space and to 

the basement room.

4. We will look into getting an outside spigot for watering the landscaping.  Using the spigot in the men’s 

room is very inconvenient and it leaks.  We hope this will be something we can get down this winter.

5.  Ann will look into getting our gutters cleaned/repaired.  Once again, the timing of losing all the leaves 

and nasty weather caused some trouble.

6.  Next month we will turn our focus to the upcoming refinancing issues for the mortgage.  We will look 

at grants and other financing options.  Our current mortgage agreement calls for a complete pay off in 

May of 2016. 

Respectfully submitted,

Molly Wingate
