Nominating Committee Report – December 2014

Peter Le Var and Molly Wingate

1. We put forth for the meeting’s approval the names in yellow on the attached list of service positions.

Treasurer – Sarah Callbeck

Meeting House committee – Phil Friesen

Contact for FCNL: Peter Le Var

Contact for FGC: Maria H.

2. We have openings, too:

Colorado Springs Representative to Colorado Regional Planning Committee:

Position on Finance Committee:  Usually this third position filled by the treasurer, but since the book 

keeper and the treasurer are the same person, it would be good to get a third person on this committee.

3. We are happy to report that we believe that this list of service positions is accurate and that everyone 

listed has confirmed their participation in the life of the meeting.
