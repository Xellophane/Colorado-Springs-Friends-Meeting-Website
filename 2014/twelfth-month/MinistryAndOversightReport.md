Ministry and Oversight Minutes, November 19, 2014

Present: Jeremy Nelson, Bill Durland and Ann Grant Martin, clerk

We opened our meeting at the Durland’s apartment with Silence and then a brief 

check-in. As is our usual practice we discussed Friends who have family/health 

challenges and those whom we haven’t seen lately.

We reviewed the success of our recent Soup and Sharing (November 9) at the 

home of Lisa Lister and Phil Friesen. This gathering was well attended and 

valuable as an opportunity for deep sharing. The members of M&O recommend 

that another Soup and Sharing be scheduled in March, 2015. A suggested topic is 

Stewardship of the Earth. Several queries in the Intermountain Yearly Meeting of 

the Religious Society of friends, Faith and Practice speak to this topic (Harmony 

with Nature):

1. How do we inform ourselves about how our style of living affects the global economy and the 

environment?

2. How do we exercise our respect for the balance of nature? Are we careful to avoid poisoning the 

earth, the air, and the water? Do we use the world’s resources with care and consideration for 

future generations and with respect for all life? Do we recycle all that we can?

3. How do we encourage environmental responsibility within our community?

4. How do we live in accord with our sense of God in all creation?

We invite Business Meeting to set a date for our next Soup and Sharing, come to 

Unity about the topic and inquire about where Friends would like to hold this 

gathering…..a Friend’s home or our Meeting House?

Members of M&O encourage the Meeting’s interest in holding a book discussion 

of one or several sessions on The Essential Elias Hicks. We believe this supports 

Adult Religious Education. We recommend that the Meeting have a standing 

Adult Religious Education Committee that can become active when needed.

We will continue to reflect on what we can do to encourage the expansion of our 

Meeting’s members and attenders. How do we encourage and retain existing 

members and attenders? We ask Friends to join us in contemplating this

question. (added later: Our Meeting’s Clerk, Lisa Lister has offered to join M&O’s 

January meeting to discuss “Quaker Quest.”   

Quaker Quest is a program of spiritual deepening and meaningful transformation for Quaker meetings 

that are considering reaching out to newcomers.  It affirms that the Quaker way is a simple, radical, and 

contemporary spiritual path, and encourages Quakers to share their spiritual experiences. Quaker Quest 

was developed by Quakers in England and adapted by FGC.)

Our next meeting will be at the Durlands on December 22, 2015 at 2:00 PM.

In the Light,           Ann Grant Martin, Clerk of Ministry and Oversight Committee
