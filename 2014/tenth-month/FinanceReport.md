# Finance Committee Meeting Minutes

## October 11, 2014
Members in Attendance: [Sarah Callbeck][SarahCallbeck] and 
[Lisa Beckrich][LisaBeckrich]

1.  **Cash Flow Report**: The Finance Committee received many donations in 
    September, including a generous donation of $400. The committee expresses 
    gratitude for these contributions. These donations allowed the Emergency 
    Reserve to be partially replenished with $50, the Assessment Reserve to 
    be completed with $240, and $35 to be added to the Travel Reserve. While 
    the ending bank balance appears increased from the beginning of the month, 
    it includes $100 of disbursements to other organizations which were not 
    paid until October. This means that the ending checking account balance 
    would be $330 once the outstanding disbursements are factored in.  

2.  **Savings**: The Travel Fund shows a decrease due to a scholarship given 
    for member travel to Colorado Regional's Fall Gathering. Both Building 
    Reserves and Emergency and Sufferings Funds show an increase. The Mortgage 
    Reserve is less than half of what it should be. This deficit will need to 
    be addressed in the future. The Meeting Home Committee has requested $300 
    for installation of electrical outlets. Only $236.79 is available for this 
    project.

3.  **Utilities**: The Meeting's utilities usage cost shows a continued downward 
    trend, and we now have a small credit on our account to apply against winter 
    costs.

4.  **Financial Needs for October through December**: The Finance Committee 
    kindly asks that the Meeting hold the following needs in the Light: in order 
    to maintain a bank balance of $150, total donations of $250 would be of benefit; 
    the Emergency Reserves fund needs another $150 to replenish it; and additional 
    funds would be appreciated in order to adequately cover early 2015 travel 
    needs for the Meeting and to continue making improvements to the meetinghouse. 

5.  **Pledge Letter**: The annual pledge letter with stewardship opportunity form 
    will be mailed October 18th, in preparation for developing our 2015 budget.
