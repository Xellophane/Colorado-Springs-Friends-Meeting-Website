Present for the Finance Committee Meeting:  [Sarah Callbeck][SarahCallbeck],
[Ann Daugherty][AnnDaugherty], [Julie Roten-Valdez][JulieRoten-Valdez], and
[Lisa Beckrich][LisaBeckrich]

1.  Meeting opened with a moment of silence

2.  The Finance Committee discussed the allocation of [Kathy Ide][KathyIde]'s 
    generous bequest of $5,000 to Colorado Springs Friends Meeting.  Meeting 
    House Committee has suggested that some of the bequest be used for 
    building reserve needs.  The meeting overview included a discussion of 
    allocation of [Kathy Ide]'s bequest based upon the following reserve needs:
	
    *.  $540 towards reserves for three months of utilities payments
	  
    *.  $10 towards emergency fund to place it at a fully funded $575 plus monthly dividends 
           
    *.  $1,430 towards reserves for three months of mortgage payments

    This allocation would allow for a total of $1,980 to meet reserve needs.  
    The allocation would then allow for the remaining bequest of $3,020 to be used as seed 
    money for the planned addition to the Meeting House.  The Finance Committee would 
    respectfully propose the following queries to the Meeting:

    1.  Does the Meeting approve of the Meeting House Committee's  suggestion to use some of 
        the bequest for building reserve needs?

    2.  Does the Meeting approve of the Finance Committee's proposal as to how 
        to distribute the bequest?

3.  The Finance Committee acknowledged and discussed requests for travel to Pendle 
    Hill ($120) and IMYM ($200) for the Durlands.  Additionally, [Molly Wingate][MollyWingate] 
    requested $100 in aid in order to assist in her travel to Phoenix as Recording Clerk of 
    Representatives Committee.  Funds for these trips totaling $420 are available due to 
    some 2013 year-end donations. 

4.  Cash flow for the 2013 year was discussed. There has been a slight decline in cash flow
    over the course of the last 5 months of 2013. The bank balance has been affected by the 
    quarterly payout for donations as well as a few other expenses. There will be a decrease 
    in Dex payments (the saved payments for Dex will be added to the travel fund).  
    Additionally, the website reserve will go down in March from a 3-month-at-a-time to a 
    1-month-at-a-time reserve each month. 

5.  Also under consideration for the Finance Committee were the funds available 
    for January.  It was decided that the Meeting will pay $100 to Friends General 
    Conference; it is our yearly pledge to FGC.  Assessments were not finalized at 
    this time; a new member may have been added.  A utilities update will be e-mailed 
    to Finance Committee members as soon as the bill is available online. 

6.  Financial statements are in progress and will be presented to the Business Meeting. 

7.  [Sarah Callbeck][SarahCallbeck] is also preparing the year end letters for 
    tax purposes for Meeting members. 

8.  The Financial Committee would like to make the Meeting aware that Friends 
    Fiduciary has changed its fossil fuel investment policy. [Sarah Callbeck][SarahCallbeck] 
    will bring the October letter regarding the investment changes to Business Meeting. 

9.  The Finance Committee Meeting closed with a moment of silence.
