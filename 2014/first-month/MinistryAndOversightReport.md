# Ministry and Oversight Minutes, 
Jan. 10, 2014

Present: [Bill Durland][BillDurland], [Jeremy Nelson][JeremyNelson] and 
[Ann Grant Martin][AnnGrantMartin], Clerk. 

[Genie Durland][GenieDurland] joined us at about 11:00 AM.

Colorado Springs Quaker Meeting House, 950 E. Cimarron St., Colorado Springs, 80909

We opened with Spiritual Silence at 10:06 AM. 

Since [Bill][BillDurland]  and [Jeremy][JeremyNelson] are new to the M&O Committee 
we took some time to get acquainted after check-in.

There are several Quaker calls to members and attenders that need to be completed.
[Bill][BillDurland]: and [Jeremy][JeremyNelson] volunteered to contact those Friends. 
Since [Bill][BillDurland] needed to be contacted, [Jeremy][JeremyNelson] and 
[Ann][AnnGrantMartin] queried him about how "He is with the Meeting." 

Our last item on the agenda was to begin formulating guidelines for the disbursal of Quaker 
emergency funds. It was the sense of this Meeting that although some guidelines are necessary, 
we want to avoid making them too rigid. For the next meeting, each of us will draft our ideas of 
Quakerly ways to administer these funds. We also want to look at how Ministry and Oversight 
and a Committee for Suffering are related.

In our February meeting we will begin a discussion of the role Ministry and Oversight can take 
to nurture the Health of the Meeting and to meet the needs of Members and attenders. We 
will look specifically at the Religious Education program for youth and adults and Peace and 
Justice matters. 

We closed in Silence at 11:25 AM.

In the Light, [Ann Grant Martin][AnnGrantMartin], Clerk
