Meeting opened in spiritual quiet, 3 PM at Durlands'

Proposed Agenda: Approved

1.  Final comments on phone calls
2.  Contact Sherry McMahon
3.  Pending question re Jennifer Roberts and Pam Hazelton: whether
    approve sharing their information in directory with IMYM
4.  Discussion on greeters – function of M&O
5.  Up-date on Shii Koeii Community requests
6.  M&O responsibilities for people who do not have cars, getting to
    meeting.

Martha Lutz said she would contact Sherry, Jennifer and Pam. We
discussed how best to participate in greeting people, including how
other meetings handle it. We shared confidential M&O information derived
from phone calls and how to resolve it. Bill announced that Shii Koeii
Community’s request for worship group is on hold pending Val Phillips'
transfer of membership to our meeting. We are aware of the need for
people without cars. It was suggested that we prepare a list of people
who are willing to make pick-ups before meeting so that carless Friends
might call to request rides. We agreed to change the name of the M&O
Mission Statement to "M&O Guidelines." In the remaining time, we
discussed the application of the guidelines to our responsibilities.
Some discussion ensued about expressing the need for people to be
sensitive to the need of the Meeting, based on silent worship centering
down, being open to the Spirit, to use every effort to arrive on time.
We are sensitive, as well, to the difficulty of that for some Friends,
and those with personal reasons for being unable to arrive on time or
attend a full meeting. We are looking for ways that Friends, who are
late, can join the meeting without affecting the spirit of the meeting.
We discussed whether to meet next at the Meeting House or Durlands'. The
sense was to continue at Durlands' for now.

Respectfully submitted,

Bill Durland, Clerk, September 10, 2012 On behalf of M&O Committee
