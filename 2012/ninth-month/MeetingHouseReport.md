Meeting House Committee Report
==============================

September 2012

Emeeting: [Molly Wingate](/Friends/MollyWingate/), [Ann
Daugherty](/Friends/AnnDaugherty/), [Daniel
Kidney](/Friends/DanielKidney/)

1.  We will have the electricians out in the next few days to install
    heaters in the bathrooms and storage area and install electrical
    outlets in the basement.

2.  Daniel Kidney put up the white boards in the basement.

3.  Lisa Lister has arranged for a 25 X 15 foot carpet to be installed
    in the meeting room. She has donated the binding of the carpet. We
    believe that this carpeting will have a good effect on our
    acoustics.

4.  We have prepared the windowsills (exterior) for painting.

5.  Lisa is lettering our sign!

6.  Finance Committee has made it clear that we have spent all the money
    we can on the meeting house until we raise some more.

7.  We request that those Friends who have mentioned donating space
    heaters consider dropping them off soon.

8.  Work Day September 23rd:

    -   Paint the window sills
    -   Housekeeping
    -   Yard tidying
    -   Install the new security mailbox to the inside of the front door
        (so we can quit paying for a P. O. Box)
    -   Remove paint that came off of the ceiling from the heater and
        fire it up
