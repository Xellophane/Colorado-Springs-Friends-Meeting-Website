   Molly started off by passing around an hand-out.

   We have also agreed to keep $8,000 on hand just in case the heaters both 
   break. I think that we have to always have $8,000 available, and that 
   can include the prudent reserve and the money we have in Friends' 
   Fiduciary Fund. I don't want to put us in jeopardy, but I don't think we have
   hold $15,671.24 in reserve, either. We have $2,715.25 (historic, not market
   value) in Friends Fiduciary. That and our regular reserve will give us 
   $10,386.50 in available funds, in case the heaters break. **How much more do
   Friends think we should keep in reserve?**

   We are getting bids for renovating the upstairs and basement of the Meeting
   House.

   **The question is: how much can we spend right now?**

2. `Genie`_ asked if the heater downstairs includes a heater for the basement? `Molly`_
   replied, no, the heater reserve was only for the main rooms upstairs. `Barbara`_ asked
   for clarification about the $7621 and other $8,000 for the heaters and the $15-16,000
   for the renovation. `Ann`_ claried that the electrician didn't provide a bid for baseboard
   heaters for the basement but that wouldn't take very much more than the $1,800 electrical
   upgrade to $2,000. `Molly`_ responded that space heaters have already been donated for 
   the basement.  

   `Marie`_ asked about `Molly`_ wanting to talk to the children of the Meeting. `Molly`_ 
   replied that she would talk to them after the called meeting.

   `Ginger`_ summarized that there is $25,207 total with $7,671.24 in prudent 
   reserve, $1,800 for the electrical upgrade, and $1,000 has already been 
   paid for the roof. There is about $15,000 left with $8,000 for the heater 
   reserve and $2,715.25 in the Friends Fiduciary account. $18,500 is the total
   funds from which we need to determine to set aside in the reserve.

   `Linda`_ asked we consider what is the amount we need to move in now that 
   we purchased the Meeting House? There will be lots of opportunities for 
   fund raising once we move into the Meeting House. `Molly`_ responded that 
   Murphy Construction hasn't given us a firm bid but she got the impression that the
   total cost to renovating the Meeting Home which includes removing the babtismal 
   pool, removing the stadium seating, refinishing the main floor, and expanding and
   fixing the basement for the `First Day School`_ would be between $11,000 and 
   $12,000.  

   `Bill`_ commented that the prudent solution is not to privelege money in the bank 
   over tangible use. He has been part of organizations that valued money in the bank
   over purchasing a needed tractor and that money is just the medium of exchange and
   that he supports spending the money now to fix the Meeting House. `Bill`_ also
   mentioned that Friends and other had originally donated to the Building Funds with
   the intention that the Meeting would spend it on a Meeting House and not just 
   reside in the bank.

   `Jennifer`_ leans towards approval and we should review our options when it is time
   to replace the heaters.

   `Marie` is comfortable having $8,000 in prudent reserve while mentally reflecting 
   on her and her family recent experiences with purchasing property that unplanned 
   expenses and repairs come up when owning a house or building. She said we should be
   more flexible with reserves, instead setting aside money for "x", her experience
   is that "ac" also occur. `Marie`_ requests that reserve at $8,000 should be for 
   "weird stuff that happens" and that the $8,000 be the floor for the reserve and
   that if we dip below $8,000 in the reserve, the Meeting should make the best effort
   to bring up the ready reserve over $8,000.

   `Martha`_ asked what is the minimum renovation needed for us to move in? `Molly`_ 
   provided an estimate of 8k to fix the basement if we did nothing for now on the 
   main floor. 

   `Linda`_ said the $11-12,000 Murphy Construction bid was reasonable but that she 
   would not be comfortable if the bid was $15,000 or more. `Molly`_ will try to 
   get the bid from the contractor tomorrow, Murphy Construction usually gives fair
   bids for work.

   `Ginger`_ was curious about speaking with other contractors if the Murphy bid 
   is too large. `Molly`_ was not excited too open it up to other contractor bids 
   and we wouldn't dip below the $8,000 reserve. `Ginger`_ mentioned we should
   invest now for when the heaters need replacing. `Molly`_ agreed.

   `Linda`_ suggested that the Home Meeting committee send email around to the 
   meeting if the Murphy Construction bid was too hight.

   `Daniel`_ suggested that we have $8,000 in fluid reserves and with the Friends 
   Fiduciary amount for a total reserve amount of $10,000. The other funds should
   be made available to renovate the Meeting Home.

3. `Ginger`_ next asked if the meeting had consensus that there should $10,000 in 
   prudient reserve with the understanding that $2,715.25 is in Friends 
   Fiduciary account. Use of the reserve should be flexible and that `Molly`_ and
   `Meeting Home`_ committee should proceed if the bid from Murphy Construction is
   in the $11,000 to $12,000. Friends were in agreement.

4. The Special Called Meeting was adjourned.
