Meeting Home Committee

April 2012 report
-----------------

We have completed our task.  The meeting has a meetinghouse. We closed 
on March 23rd on the church at 950 E. Cimarron Avenue for $92,500.  We 
are fully insured. We agreed to pay the deductible for the seller's 
insurance to replace the roof.  `Ginger Morgan`_, `Ann Daugherty`_, and 
`Brian Murphy`_ did the paperwork while `Carlton Gamer`_ and `Molly Wingate`_
held the proceedings in the Light.

The committee has been tracking down various details and tasks in hopes 
of starting to meet there on May 7, 2012.

1. We switched the utilities and mail to our meeting

2. `Fountain Valley Electrical`_ is upgrading our electric service.

3. `Murphy Constructors`_ are putting together a bid to renovate the 
   basement and do the big job renovations in the meeting room.
   
4. `Daniel Kidney`_ stabilized the fence.

5. `Ann Daugherty`_ has been tracking down the details on everything, 
   especially the roof.
    
We met on April 4th  to discuss our progress and next steps.  
In attendance:  `Julie Roten-Valdez`_, `Carlton Gamer`_, 
`Ann Daugherty`_ (clerk), `Molly Wingate`_, and `Linda Seger`_ joined 
us, too.  

1. We discussed the projects we need to complete so we can move in.  
   We don’t have a dollar figure for costs, so we will ask the Meeting 
   how much they want to keep in reserves so we don’t overspend. We 
   have approximately $25,000 available after closing. We will get 
   solid figures from `Sarah Callbeck`_ and bring the question to 
   Meeting on Sunday.
   
2. We suggest that the `Meeting Home Committee`_ be put down and that a 
   new `Meeting House Committee`_ is formed. `Meeting Home`_ has 
   completed its charge, and now we have many new things to do.
   
We suggest that the Meetinghouse Committee have five areas of responsibility:
    
* Maintenance/Renovation of the meetinghouse

* Grounds – trees, bushes, irrigation and landscaping

* Sweat Equity Projects – inventory projects, organize work days, 
  purchase supplies
  
* Working with Contractors- be the point of contact for contractors, get
  bids, follow up
  
* Fundraising – Create a plan to raise funds to pay off the building, to 
  build our addition. 

We thought it would be good to have a person in charge of each area and 
for those people to gather helpers as needed. These areas will overlap.  
When the meeting decides what to do, then the `Nominating committee`_ 
can fill the committee.  (feel free to volunteer!)


1. We identified several immediate projects that we should be able to 
   handle:
   
   1. Stabilize the fence
   
   2. Clean the basement windows and replace broken glass

   3. Clean the interior of the whole building

   4. Sell auditorium seats and large podium on ebay and craigslist.

2. We would like to ask the members and attenders to consider donating 
   items to the meetinghouse:

   1. Area rug(s) for the basement

   2. Book cases 

   3. Sofas or comfy chairs for the basement

   4. Chairs for the meeting room.  We think that we won’t know what we 
      want for seating until we meet for a while, so we ask that Friends 
      donate any chairs that would work for worship, at least for the 
      interim.  We have 6 or 7 wooden chairs, two tables, and two small 
      podiums (podia?) that came with the meetinghouse.
      
   5. Folding tables for potlucks.

   6. 5' folding screens. 
   
We closed in silence.
