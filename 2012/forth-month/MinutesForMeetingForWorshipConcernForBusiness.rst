      has request certain categories for census. `Jeremy`_ is converting directory to 
      electronic format. `Bill`_ hasn't dealt with address, some entries may not have
      telephone, numbers, and address for correct information. People correct own 
      information or are aware that some information is incorrect for some else. 

      The advantage of this , thanks for `Bill`_ in compiling, `Jeremy`_, IMYM wants it 
      out by end of April.

      Last two months have been very active for the past two months. The question about
      `Tup`_ and `Dede`_ memorial , no affirmative request from family for the Meeting
      for formal memorial. `M&O`_  asks if Meeting would have own memorial, inquiry to 
      what is the right thing to do? `Molly`_ would like to have a memorial, she feels
      that enough time has past, maybe a Sunday in May or June about an event. More 
      relatives are coming in June, `Molly`_ and `Martha`_ will plan this event.

      `Ginger`_ shared from her work on the IMYM Peace and Social concern meetings that IMYN acknowledges
      that in smaller meetings, some business is conjoined into a smaller committee,
      `Adult Education and Social Action`_ combines what in larger meetings would be separate
      Adult Education and Peace and Social Concerns.
      
      `Joyce`_ and `Jeremy`_ have agreed to serve on the `Adult Education and 
      Social Action Committee`_, Meeting accepts revised Mission statement.

   c. Friends Mountain Camp Queries from IMYM
      
      Queries on the back, six queries. If Friends can be very courageous, if this is 
      
      `Ginger`_ read the queries. 

        1. Should IMYM 

        2. What is the yearly meeting able to do at the present? What are potential problems
           and fears IMYM have?

        3. MFC as a separate organization 

        4. IMYM MFC..

        5. Do monthly meeting support directly MFC or IMYM? Our meeting already directly supports
           MFC.

        6. If MFC part of IMYM.. 

        7. Meeting came out from IMYM Continuing Committee, improves Meeting $10,000 additional
         
      `Molly`_ IMYM and Joint Services committee, make it a regular part of IMYM to have a fund raising
      role, MFC make a permanent standing committee of IMYM with Monthly Meeting representation.
    
      `Genie`_ we are not in the position to take up queries should be part of IMYM, 
      strongly support that MFC be a part of IMYM. `Molly`_ took up   

      `Sarah`_ not be cut loose from IMYM so important to development of young friends 
      committee. YF can be immersed in Quakers life. 

      `Ginger`_ would friends support for a fee for camp? Yes, with current model of funding with
      a scholarship or other support for YF to attend? Yes.

      It is the sense of Colorado Springs Friends MFC should be established as a program of IMYM and under the 
      oversight of a standing committee of IMYM, (Appendices B Number 2 option). Colorado Springs 
      currently supports MFC directly. Colorado Spring Meeting supports MFC charged with a fee 
      with the understanding that scholarship or other support of YF who need it.  
      
      Do Friends support a yearly $100 donation to MFC continuing forward? `Molly`_ approve supporting 
      MFC encourage so long as MFC is associated with IMYM. Yes. `Genie`_ doesn't have a lot of faith
      that IMYM will raise assessments to support MFC. We support a modest increase in assessment and
      MFC fees. IMYM raising its assessment to support MFC Continuing Committee recommendation of $10,000. 

   d. Resignation of Clerk

      `Ginger`_'s family moving this summer. The last Business for Meeting in May `Ginger`_ can 
      attend. We usually suspend `Business for Meeting`_ in June and July and we can't do it this
      year. `Molly`_ , `Lisa`_ notes deep gratitude to `Ginger`_ as her service in clerk for `M&O`_
      and as Clerk of our meeting. Quakers operate in loving and altruistic suggest to us and for
      us by other Quaker organization. Nominating committee .. We have a party in the new meeting
      house for `Ginger`_. `Ginger`_ has a "holy" desire to serve as clerk of a meeting for worship
      for business in the new meeting house.
