============================
INTERMOUNTAIN YEARLY MEETING 
============================
OF THE RELIGIOUS SOCIETY OF FRIENDS (QUAKERS)
---------------------------------------------

Dear Friends:

The Mountain Friends Camp has had two successful summer sessions. It is time for the yearly
meeting to decide how the camp will relate to the yearly meeting and what support we, as
a yearly meeting, regional meetings, monthly meetings, individual Friends and parents and
campers will provide. Ana Easterling with a few other volunteers has made this camp possible.
This year the camp plans to move to an existing camping facility in Tin Cup Colorado in the Four
Corners region and extend the session to two weeks. Information on the camp can be found at
the IMYM.org website, from campers and from Ana and others on the ad hoc committee.

At Executive Committee this August we spent time talking about the issue of how the camp
will/should relate to the yearly meeting and agreed to send some queries to the monthly
meetings for consideration. These ideas will be brought to the annual session so the timeframe
is to have responses by May. If we are to summarize them for the Documents in Advance, May
1, is an absolute deadline. I will remind you all in April if I have not heard from your meeting.
We also enthusiastically approved forwarding the funding requests and a request to make the
Mountain Friends Camp Committee a standing committee of the yearly meeting.

In addition to the responses to the queries, the Mountain Friends’ Camp needs members from
every meeting for the ad hoc camp and committee. The committee meets by conference
call on the first Sunday evening of each month. If no one from your meeting has the time or
interest to be a committee member, a person who will act as contact for camp communications
and advocate for the camp would be welcome. Youth are also welcome to serve on the
committee. I am attaching the position description for the Mountain Friends’ Camp Committee
membership. The current clerks of this committee are Eric Wright and Valerie Ireland who can
provide more information.

Camp has operated on a shoestring for the past two years with volunteer time for staffing
the camp and donated or loaned equipment. It is now time to begin to provide the financial
support that the staff deserves and that is necessary for sustainability. It is amazing what has
been done by a few individuals with so little in the way of financial resources. There are various
models for funding the camp, some of which are considered in the queries. For the current

year, it is hoped that meetings will provide financial support both by donating directly to the
camp (through IMYM) and by providing camperships to the youth in their meeting who wish to
attend. Camp costs have been kept purposely low, but some families may need assistance for
their children to attend.

The queries that we are asked to consider follow:

-  Do we as a yearly meeting want to continue running a summer camp for youth? What
   structure and relationship would support the need for the camp to have a realistic
   budget, insurance, a method for paying staff, and possibly even owning property?
   
-  What is the yearly meeting able to do at present and what are potential problems 
   and fears about taking on a more formal sponsoring relationship?
   
-  Would the yearly meeting support establishing the camp as a separate non-profit
   organization and, if so, what would the relationship be with IMYM?
   
-  How can the ad hoc Camp Committee effectively communicate with monthly meetings,
   recruit committee members, and publicize the camp?
   
-  Do monthly meetings support contributing directly to MFC? Including Camp in the
   IMYM budget and putting money into the camp from the general fund (meaning that
   there would need to be additional money raised for this purpose either through the
   assessment or in other ways)? Supporting campers so that the camp could rely more
   on camper fees for ongoing expenses? Please suggest how your meeting would like
   to support the camp.
   
-  If the Camp is a program of the yearly meeting, does the yearly meeting need to
   formalize its organization to allow paying staff and providing oversight?

Please forward any responses from your meeting or individual Friends to me at
coleonard@gilanet.com or PO Box 727, Reserve, NM 87830.

Claire Leonard, clerk, IMYM
