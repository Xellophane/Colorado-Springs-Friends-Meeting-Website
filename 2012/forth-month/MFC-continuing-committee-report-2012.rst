Mountain Friends Camp report to IMYM Continuing Committee
=========================================================

In 2011 Mountain Friends Camp continued to gain momentum.  Our second year of camp was a 
powerful experience of community, collaboration, and simple living for 10 campers and 6 staff 
representing four states and 7 monthly meetings.  Evaluations from campers and staff were thoughtful 
and enthusiastic, e.g. “Fantastic! I love it here with all of my friends and the beauty of nature”, “I liked 
being with the other campers talking best.  Everyone was so accepting and nice.”  and “amazing! I 
think this is the most fun I've had working in a loooong time”. See imym.org/mtnfrcamp for full 
evaluations, report to executive committee, newsletters and much more information.  

This summer camp will be at Timberline Trails in Tincup Colorado this summer from June 23-
July 7 with staff days beginning June 20.  We can welcome up to 24 campers to each of two week-long 
sessions, and hope to offer staff a small stipend. Timberline Trails is a non-profit organization with 
decades of summer camp experience; we'll benefit from their infrastructure, advice and gorgeous 
mountain location. The owners have generously offered us their camp and insurance coverage at no 
cost. Look for more information on the location and our plans in registration materials.

Our goals for 2011 were to "increase awareness of and participation in our summer camp, to 
include dedicated staff training days before campers arrive, and to continue to plan towards the long-
term future of Mountain Friends Camp".  Positive reports and word-of-mouth excitement from our 
2010 camp, as well as the seven weeks Ana Easterling and Ariel Bibby spent traveling around IMYM 
to talk with Friends about Mountain Friends Camp, certainly helped our community grow.  If we'd had 
a bus (and supplies, food and very flexible parents!) for all the JYF who got excited about camp during 
IMYM 2011 we could have doubled the number of campers. Our new brochure and three newsletters in 
2011 received positive feedback, and a growing number of MFC liaisons stepped up to connect us with 
their Monthly Meetings.

Our goal of dedicated staff training days was dropped reluctantly due to the change in location. 
Although our staff members pulled together and adapted quickly, all agreed the staff need time this 
summer to prepare and bond before campers arrive.  This year we're planning on up to four staff days.

Progress towards our future goals was our major focus after camp ended.  We visited two 
promising new locations; received enthusiastic encouragement, and approval to forward our report and 
queries to Monthly Meetings, from Executive Committee; were awarded a grant from Boulder 
Meeting's Waskey fund to provide a stipend to our camp director; worked with IMYM treasurer and 
finance committee to improve our accounting system, and decided to open our own bank account; 
registered "Mountain Friends Camp" trade name in CO as an "unincorporated nonprofit association"; 
asked questions of and studied other Quaker summer camps; researched our options regarding legal 
structure, incorporation, and hiring employees or independent contractors; started developing a 
website; and, thanks to our liaisons, requested and received donations from 6 monthly and regional 
meetings. Discerning the future shape of MFC is crucial as our committee members and staff have 
determined that our pilot programs, while wonderful experiences, are not sustainable in terms of 
overburdened volunteers, shoestring budget and informal legal/institutional status. 

Currently our ad hoc committee holds monthly conference calls and is developing structure with 
new clerks, interim recording clerk and interim treasurer. We hope to formalize our committee and 
recruit/nominate more members this year.  

Action items and Questions for Continuing Committee:
 
 * approve our proposal for a standing camp committee of IMYM (appendix A)
 
 * consider affiliation with Mountain Friends Camp, a recommendation for IMYM (appendix B)
 
 * consider MFC Treasurer's report and increased financial support from IMYM in 2013 (appendix C)

Respectfully submitted,

Anastacia Easterling, Camp Director; Valerie Ireland, and 
Eric Wright, Camp Committee Clerks 


Appendix A: INTERMOUNTAIN YEARLY MEETING OF THE RELIGIOUS SOCIETY OF FRIENDS (QUAKERS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mountain Friends Camp Committee:

*Purpose*: To develop and conduct a camp for Quaker youth, especially those from Intermountain 
Yearly Meeting, as well as welcome any drawn to a community based on Quaker values, encouraging 
spiritual and personal growth and a sense of community in young people.

*Organization*: The Committee is open to any interested Friends with the desire to see the camp grow 
and become self sustaining.  Members from each region in the Yearly Meeting are desired including 
youth and adults.  The clerk will be chosen from the membership of the Committee by the committee 
members.  Committee members will serve three year terms and may serve up to two consecutive 
terms.  The clerk will serve for three years from the time of appointment.  The Committee may choose 
to contract with a camp director or other staff as needed to do the work of the Committee.  The 
presiding clerk of the Yearly Meeting will serve as an ex officio member.   Individuals with special 
expertise may be co-opted to serve on the Committee. 

*Structure*: The majority of the work of the Committee will be done by conference call.  These calls will 
occur monthly at a time set by the Committee.  There will be one or more face to face meetings per 
year as necessary.  Camp staff and campers will be welcome to join the committee, and committee 
members will be welcome to attend camp.

*Skills sought*: Friends with experience in Quaker process and organizations, youth camps, youth 
development, outdoor skills, fund raising, organizing nonprofits, outdoor cooking and nutrition, 
various activities relevant to outdoor living, wilderness medicine, and other relevant areas are 
particularly sought.

*Responsibilities*: During the first term of service, 2011-2014, the primary focus of the Committee will 
be on developing the business plan for the camp and conducting camp sessions each summer.  
Specific tasks will include but not be limited to the following:
  
  * Develop vision and mission statements.

  * Revise the initial 5 year plan in light of the experience in the first two years of camp.  Develop a 
    second 5 year plan (2014-2019).
    
  * Consider applying for formal affiliation with IMYM, corporate status, 
    501&copy;3 designation.
  
  * Plan for years 3 and 4 of camp (Site selection, acquiring equipment, 
    creating a staffing plan, etc.)
    
  * Develop a budget for years 3, 4, and 5 and conduct fund raising efforts.
  
  * Publicity (website development and maintenance, facebook, 
    newsletter, brochures, outreach to Monthly and Regional Meetings as 
    well as JYF/SYF/YAF groups, etc.).
    
  * Develop job descriptions, hire and oversee staff for camp sessions.
  
  * Support camp staff and conduct evaluations of camp experience.
  
*Other*: In addition to membership on the Committee, liaisons from each 
Monthly Meeting are also being recruited.  These individuals would serve 
to connect the Mountain Friends Camp Committee with their Monthly 
Meetings and the youth of the Meeting.  No attendance at meetings of the 
Committee would be required but liaisons would be welcome to join any or
all conference calls.




Appendix B: The Future of IMYM & MFC: three models for consideration 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. *Affiliated*: separate yet connected 
	
	* MFC is a separate entity, likely a nonprofit organization, 
	  responsible for taxes, finances, insurance, staff, and operating 
	  the summer camp
	  
	* IMYM appoints all or some board members. YM receives reports, 
	  nurtures and supports staff and works to promote awareness and 
	  participation
	  
	* financial support, for lower income families, to pay staff, 
	  buy/maintain property... but MFC controls finances.
	  
	* Sierra Friends Camp (College Park QM-PYM), Western Friend magazine, 
	  similarities to our affiliations with AFSC, FCNL, FWCC 	

2. IMYM operates a camp 

    * Standing committee of YM serves as a board of directors. Sets the 
      goals, sets or approves budget, hires staff (as independent 
      contractors or employees), evaluates success of camp program.
      
	* Taxes, property, payroll, insurance policy that protects YM, 
	  committee members, staff and  campers. Camp could have separate 
	  IMYM bank account, camp staff/committee members responsible 
      for additional paperwork. finances/reserves could be separate or 
      combined with general YM budget 
      
	* New England YM, Baltimore YM, Canadian YM, Ohio Valley YM operate 
	  summer camps. 
	  
	* BYM "Many people in our YM believe that our camps are our greatest
	  and most successful outreach in terms of bringing new families 
	  into Quakerism.  Our camps are our single largest program, 
      about 56% of the entire budget of our YM is the activities of the 
      Camps."

3.  MFC is independent Quaker camp

	* Camp trustees/board of directors operates a camp.  
	
	* No legal connection or oversight from YM, but cooperation in 
	  recruiting staff and campers, help with projects, financial 
	  support and sharing resources are very possible
	  
	* Farm and Wilderness, Dark Waters, Onas, Woodbrooke, Celo... tend 
	  to have less Quaker process/presence at camp, no accountability to 
	  a Quaker meeting, but perhaps more general appeal? Focus on 
	  values, sustainability, rather than spirituality, open to more 
	  grants and donations.

Incorporation
-------------
The MFC committee has been considering incorporating as a nonprofit.  
Benefits include limited liability protection and a legal identity.  We 
have already secured the trade name "Mountain Friends Camp" and an 
Employer Identification Number (EIN) in order to open a bank account. We 
do not need to incorporate in 2012 to have camp at Timberline Trails.

Incorporation at the state level is a first step to applying for 501c3 
status with the IRS, however we have not decided if that is an immediate
or long-term goal.  Benefits of 501c3 status include access to grants, 
tax-exempt status and tax-deductible donations, postage discounts, as 
well as "legitimacy" as we expand our camp community and reach out to 
non-Friends.

If IMYM, as a recognized church, chooses to register for 501c3 status, 
MFC would exist within the programs and activities of the YM.  Our 
mission, of providing a summer camp grounded in Quaker values, would 
qualify us as an exempt church business. Some advise that churches face 
less paperwork and taxes than other nonprofits, however we would lose 
access to funds for youth development, environmental education, etc. 
that exclude religious groups.

*Cons*: cost of filing with IRS ~$900; hassle of filing ~100 hours, 3-9 
months (but maybe it's a valuable exercise to clarify our mission and 
business plan); ethical considerations? Corporations, government, 
taxes... how do we relate as Friends?

Minutes of Mountain Friends Camp (MFC) 
--------------------------------------

Committee Meeting December 4th 2011 via conference call (approved Jan, 1 2012)

1. We approved the intent of MFC Minute #2: "Friends approve articles 
   of incorporation to be prepared for Mountain Friends Camp and filed 
   in the state of Colorado. Board members for the purpose of 
   incorporation include: Valerie Ireland; Eric Wright, Claire Leonard, 
   Brenda Chung for terms of one year, ending Dec. 1 2012." 
   
   We will bring this Minute forth to Continuing Committee (CC) meeting in 
   January 2012 for seasoning as part of the discussion on MFC's 
   relationship with yearly meeting. We recognize that our close 
   relationship with, and on-going support from, Friends, monthly 
   meetings and the yearly meeting is the most important factor in the 
   continued success of MFC. As such, we will not carry out the action 
   of this minute pending the discussion at CC meeting."
