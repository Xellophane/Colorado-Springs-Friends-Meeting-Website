       adult education keep meeting apprised of social action of Friends and opportunities. No suggestion of a 
       mandoray nature of adult education and social action. Suggest written charge to allow the committee to 
       move forward. Is discussion of charge meet need, with good encouragement and grateful for work, suggest
       that committee go forward. `Genie`_ indicate willingness to serve as clerk of this committee. 
 

   c. Meeting Home
     
     i. Report on 950 E. Cimmarron

        `Brian`_ where we are in the contract process. Seller offers a price for what they to, buyer and sellers and go into
        contract, physical inspection of property, review of title. Parties come back together and decide what to do from
        here. A few choices for this property. Number of options ranging from rejectionn to accept offer as-is, or somewhere
        in between. Come back with a list of things Seller will do, we are at the stage to tell seller what we would like to 
        have seller change. Seller with asking price, building is not pristine. Title committment, title insurance, with any
        exceptions. One exception for restriction, photocopy of hand-written deed, unreadable. Title company, certain 1906
        Church of Christ, property been seller hands over 100 years. Restriction no organ music, no festivals not sactioned
        by New Testiments. Within seller's power to remove restrictions from seller. `Bill`_, like as attorney, technical 
        removal of these restrictions, clean-up title. Important to remove restrictions for use to rent out building for concerts
        or other event. 

       `Ann`_, `Julie`_, `Molly`_, and `Carlton`_ meet earlier. Electrical box needs replacement, no gutter, no heat, don't know
       what it will require to upgrade electrical box. Original box for when, not enough power to microwave and coffee maker at
       the sametime, no fuses. Getting bids for lowering, and out of way for any future additions. Don't know price for new box.
       $45 to move sprinkler head. No heat in basement, current heater is dangerous, $345 to remove gas heater. Don't plug anything.
       Install gutter and downspout $500. For purpose of contract, consider for basement heater, electrical box, sprinklers, asking
       for lower purchasing price by seller.

       The roof is bad shape, the seller's insurance company will replace root for $1000 deductable. Roof options; patch roof, or
       $1000 for new roof, $12-15,000 for new roof. Buyer write check for $1000, we have $2,000 in expenses, reduction of purchase
       price by seller. Meeting Home proposing that electrical box is dangerous and seller reduce price. We could rightful expect
       that dangerous or fire hazard need fixed. `Bill`_ asked about original price $95,000. Price reduction in line with spritual
       Quaker testomiies. In first instance we meet price, but didn't bargain on price. After inspection, legitimate buyer should expect
       certain things to be fixed. Certain things we could reasonable believe that should work, money spends to make property usable at
       all, we don't want them fix. Reduce purchase price to allow us to use property as expected. Difference between bargaining and
       more information about fairness of price? Meeting Home committee, Meeting Group reduce purchase price to reflect our good faith
       counter-offer different amount to bring building up to use as a Meeting Home. Some subjectivity, getting an asking price
       for lower because of condition of building. `Peter`_ subjectivity meaning, their asking a lower price if they what is going on
       with the building? Asking price what seller thinks of marketing, only a church could purchase this property for its usage.
       Second part of question, could the seller be surprised by inspection results. Who knows what could surprise seller? Quite a bit
       of deferred maintainance. Seller could unaware of amount of stuff that needed to fixed. `Genie`_ question? Have they been used
       building recently? Seller could reject our offer. `Bill`_, Meeting House have the flexiblity and `Ginger`_, Quakers historical 
       haven't bargaining. `Carlton`_ usability of congreation, this isn't bargaining as typical of commerical factual things to have
       building bring each party understands what transaction is, we counter-offer based on findings of inspriction, accomediated repairs
       to sellers. 2,000 and include electrical work estimate. Our usability is different than current owners, nobody in basement for years.
       Our usability use building, all over including basements and have other groups to rent building. We need it to be in good 
       condition.

       Ginger asked for a moment of siliance so we reflect and breath. 

      `Bill`_ also provide Meeting Home flexibility if seller refuses, committee have authority before next Business Meeting. What are
       our options are moving forward. `Peter`_, speaking as health profession, basement hasn't been used in a while, people may
       resportory problems.

       Could be possible to come up with estimate, we need to be careful of not losing sight of the ball. Important to articute $3-5k,
       we articulate all issues, and ask for consideration. Maybe we'll split value of considerations, for example total 5,000, we 
       responsible for 2,500 and 1,000 roof. Lowering price of offer. Second issue, heater breaks down, no replacement. Heater looks to 
       be in good shape and replace. What would it take to get heat building if current heater fails? Sufficient for possible addition,
       request meeting hold 8,000 for heater reserve. Prudient reserves we won't bring any money for a year, with no contributions.
       We have a some flexiblity in this number for heater reserve.

       Meeting Home recommends that Meeting accept financing, we will finance $57,000 at 8% in 20 years. Within 5 years, refinance $476.77
       a month. In five years, refinance $50,000. Reason for 8% because lender is not bank, no one else loan for us. With no personal 
       guarenttees, best we can do. How much money we bring and what is mortgage? Mortgage $285.00 in month is currently being donor allocated
       for building fund, $395 just for building fund and $100 rent. Some gap between $476 and $395. `Barbara`_ has no concerns about purchasing
       building.

       Meeting Home committee we can bring Meeting Home up to what we want. Renovation done in mind of Quaker testimonies. Proposed two different
       ideas; 
    
         1. $32,000 with kitchen and bathrooms in the back
  
         2. $21,000 with kitchen in current bastimal.

       We wanted to know what it cost but we can't do either one of them. Is the Meeting okay with outdoor access to bathrooms for
       the next five years. We might provide a umbrella? If Friends use restrooms as they are for up to the next five years. The Meeting
       is unity and not an obsticle for us to use restroom for up to the next five years.

       `Genie`_ can we cover both rent payment and mortgage? We, with prudient reserve and the first mortgage payment isn't due until a
       month after contract signed.   
       
       Crime report by `Carlton`_, nice to talk to police as purchaser of church. Police 7-10 turnaround for crime report. Crime calls
       in neighboorhood, 2 blocks in every direction. In past month 37 police calls, 18 had to do with suscipous person or disorderale
       contuct, 11 property, 4 violent calls by Prospect lake on opposite side of Hancock. Fairly normal neighboorhood. In the summer
       calls go up in summer, 50% calls have to do disorderly conduct with 25% with property. Compare with other neighboorhood. Went to
       Pride center, crime report. No calls around Pride center, 1 call buglery call in the past month. Along Platte and Pikes Peak, 
       a plethoria of calls. Pride center and Cimmroon property equilivant. `Joyce`_ lives in neighboorhood for past 12 years, haven't
       personal experienced crime, only a couple of noise complients. Up until 1990s, bad neighboorhood with Crack houses and 
       murders. Part of what committee did was bring in Police to saturate and cleaned up neightberhood. `Joyce`_ never heard of anything
       wrong, primary residential verse commercial. Quaker will contibute to the improvement of the neighborhood.  

       Approval of $1,000 for new roof deductable and new gutters only if Meeting approves and goes forward with purchase of Meeting? 
       Yes. Question asked about building fund, up to $12,000-23,000 after down-payment without the prudient reserve. `Genie`_ suggest
       that `Brian`_ invoice us for his services with a in-kind donation in bookkeeping, useful for grants. We would need to cover any
       expenses. 

       St. Murpheygate for every March Sundays in the future. `Ginger`_ dilience and faith, clearly and simplify deeply appericate 
       `Molly`_'s efforts on join in celebutory silence with a whoop of celerbration afterwards. 

       We are interested in moving forward with this property? Yes.

       In unity about adjusting offer price by Friends counter lower price given our discussion? Yes. 
       
       Do we have approval with Clerk, Meeting Home committee, and Brian to adjustment price? Yes. If the seller
       balks at adjustment, sense of Friends to go further with current selling price or should we continue to go
       further? No wiggle room? Flexibility and area of negotiation, clarity of Meeting? 

       Meeting Home recommends that committee have the flexility to lower purchase price by what ever amount we feel
       proper to lower or move forward with the initial price? If the price is the same, we have enough to make building
       usable, other major upgrades depends on funding. We can do some renovations but not all. Approve worst scenirio
       of 96,000 or flexiblity to reduce price? Clerk has right to sign on behalf of Meeting. Clarity and unity amoung
       Clerk and Meeting Home committee. Approve and reach unity move forward in flexiblity to reduce offer price or pay
       up to full amount including new roof. 

       Meeting Home recommend we reserve $8,000 for new heater just in case. Yes. `Bill`_ compliment clerk and meetings
       in the process, one of the best processes he has seen. One thing to help create, `Bill`_ very impressed with Home
       Committee throughness and clarity in a complex situation and multiple changes. 

       `Sarah`_ would like to attend with Meeting Home committee about how to reserve for furnace. Deep dept of graditute
       towards `Molly`_, `Carlton`_, `Julie`_, `Brian`_, and `Ann`_ with Murphy Constuction for their working. Closing
       could happen this week. Finace and Meeting Home committees have conversations after closing of house.
