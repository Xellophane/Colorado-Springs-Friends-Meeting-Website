M&O Committee Minutes
=====================

March 23, 2012
--------------
 
**Attending**: `Bill Durland`_, `Martha Lutz`_ and `Linda Seger`_.
Meeting opened in spiritual silence.
Proposed agenda approved:
 

1. Resolution of Jeremy Nelson’s and Deb Gimpleson’s meeting transfers 
   and completion of census report.

2. Up-dates on Tup and Dede memorial arrangements
   
3. Draft `Religious Education and Social Action`_ committee charge of mission.
    
4. Consideration of an M&O mission statement, including its relationship 
   to business meeting reports and issues of privacy and confidentiality.

The following discussion and actions took place.

1. Meeting Clerk reported at business meeting prior to this meeting that 
   Deb Gimpleson's transfer out to New Zealand and `Jeremy Nelson`_'s 
   transfer in to our meeting have been completed. No further action on 
   our part is necessitated.

2. `Bill`_ completed the census report and sent it on to Todd Swanson 
   for Yearly Meeting records. Copies will be sent to `Ginger`_ and `Sarah`_. 
   An up to date directory with changes and revisions on line with the 
   census report will be drafted by `Bill`_ for the next business meeting

3. The question of whether `Tup`_ and `Dede`_'s relatives wish for our 
   meeting to have memorial services for them has not been resolved. It 
   appears from `Martha`_'s inquiries that there have been no requests for 
   such a Quaker meeting. `Martha`_ will talk with `Molly`_ for her advice 
   and let us know if she has any suggestions. We will ask the Clerk and 
   `Molly`_ at the next business meeting whether we should plan for a date 
   in May to hold a short memorial service after meeting for our own needs 
   to remember our past Friends.

4  We were instructed to draft a mission statement after we renamed 
   `Adult Religious Education`_ by adding the words "Social Action."  We 
   discussed the matter and invited `Genie Durland`_, who has been 
   nominated for Clerk of the new committee to join our discussion. `Bill`_
   and `Genie`_ were asked by M&O to draft a mission statement for approval 
   by email to M&O and then to present to the business meeting. (Attached 
   is the draft approved by M&O. IMYM Faith and Practice on religious 
   education and related social action language was consulted, but there 
   was no comments on adult religious education but only on "children" and 
   that was limited to queries and advices.)

5. Discussion ensued on how M&O should handle matters of confidentiality 
   and privacy for issues presented to it from time to time require that. 
   Flowing from the discussion was the suggestion that we should formulate 
   a mission statement for M&O as well, including the above concern, as it 
   relates to the business meeting and other Friends’ activities. We put 
   this on our future agenda.


Meeting was closed in spiritual silence, holding each other in the light.
 
`Bill Durland`_, Clerk for `Peter LeVar`_, `Linda Seger`_ and 
`Martha Lutz`_
