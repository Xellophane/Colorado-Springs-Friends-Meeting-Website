Meeting for Worship for Business Minutes
========================================

Present: [Carlton Gamer](/Friends/CarltonGamer/), [Genie
Durland](/Friends/GenieDurland/), [Bill Durland](/Friends/BillDurland/),
[Sarah Callbeck](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/), [Ann
Daugherty](/Friends/AnnDaugherty/), [Molly
Wingate](/Friends/MollyWingate/) (clerk), and [Lisa
Lister](/Friends/LisaLister/) (Acting Recording Clerk).

1.  The Clerk read queries from Fort Collins Friends Newsletter, Oct.,
    2012. The following queries were read (from IMYM Faith and Practice,
    pages 117-119), which prompted Bill to propose that M&O further
    explore vocal ministry, and perhaps facilitate a discussion with the
    wider Meeting:

    -   When in meeting for worship, do I clear my mind so that the
        Spirit has a place to enter?
    -   Do I wait in great expectancy for the Spirit to speak - through
        me or through another?
    -   Do I put my trust in the still small voice that I may hear?
    -   How do I discern the source of a leading?
    -   How do I know when to speak?
    -   Do I hold myself back when moved to speak, or do I trust in the
        Light to lead me?
    -   Am I careful not to speak at undue length or beyond my light?
    -   Am I aware of a sense of "rightness" after I speak?
    -   Does attendance at meeting for worship strengthen my spirit for
        the week ahead?
    -   What brings me back to center - back to inner wisdom, home to
        myself - and how can I make that a regular practice?

    The October Minutes were accepted.

2.  The Cash Flow Reports, which were presented by Sarah (attached).

3.  Clerk's Report. We will hold our first Show and Tell on Friday,
    November 23 from 5-7 PM at the meeting house. Please bring a dish to
    share perhaps some Thanksgiving leftovers.
    [Carlton](/Friends/CarltonGamer/) will begin showing and telling.

4.  COMMITTEE REPORTS

    a.  Finance Committee report is attached.
        [Sarah](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) has been setting up our
        finances in QuickBooks. This has been taking some time and
        tweaking. Brian is setting up our tax-exempt status.
        [Sarah](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) reviewed the draft budget for
        2013-the final budget will be presented at the December business
        meeting. We also looked at the new Balance Sheet and a Revenue
        Statement output from QuickBooks to make sure we were
        comfortable with these new report layouts and content. We are
        all thankful for [Sarah](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) 's hard work,
        and the Finance Committee report was accepted with deep
        gratitude.

    b.  Nominating Committee report was given by
        [Genie](/Friends/GenieDurland/). [Bill
        Werling](/Friends/BillWerling/) and [Genie
        Durland](/Friends/GenieDurland/) are on the Nominating
        Committee. They may be contacting people about their willingness
        to serve.

        ACTION: We approved Ann Martin as a member of M&O.

    c.  Ministry and Oversight report was given by
        [Bill](/Friends/BillDurland/) and accepted with thanks. They
        discussed the greeting of visitors and how to be of support to
        [Jonathan McPhee](/Friends/JonathanMcPhee/).

        The full report is attached.

    d.  First Day School Committee. There is no written report, but the
        First Day School children will be painting a mural downstairs
        during our next work day, November 25.
        [Molly](/Friends/MollyWingate/) will be the adult presence.

    e.  Adult Education and Action Committee (Two items)

        1.  ITEM 1: Molly read a minute on divestment which was drafted
            by Genie, and is before us for consideration:

            "We, Colorado Springs Friends Meeting, Religious Society of
            Friends, embrace the spirit and support the goals of the We
            Divest Campaign of the American Friends Service Committee.

            We understand that this campaign was launched in partnership
            with Jewish Voice for Peace and that it demands that
            TIAA-CREF stop investing in corporations that enable the
            destruction of Palestinian homes and orchards, the expansion
            of Israeli settlements and infrastructure, checkpoint
            surveillance of Palestinian communities, and provide weapons
            used against civilians. The campaign does not ask people to
            directly divest from TIAA-CREF. Rather it organizes
            retirement fund recipients to exercise their rights as
            shareholders and witness to TIAA-CREF (a company with \$441
            billion in assets) to divest from corporations that profit
            from the military occupation.

            As Friends who value our testimonies of Peace, Equality,
            Community, Integrity and Simplicity and strive to live by
            them, we unite with the AFSC campaign. We see the campaign
            as an example of speaking truth to power - in this case to
            the power of unjust profit - both as individuals and as a
            Meeting. We recognize that peace in the Middle East is
            dependent upon true justice for Palestinians and so seek to
            support all nonviolent efforts to further that cause."

            ACTION: This minute was approved by the Meeting. Genie will
            let AFSC and IMYM know that we have approved this minute.

        2.  ITEM 2: Coloradans Against the Death Penalty support: Molly
            read the "Resolution of Support and Organizational
            Membership" sent to us from the Coloradans for Alternatives
            to the Death Penalty:

            "WHEREAS, the death penalty diverts millions of dollars a
            year of state resources into an arbitrary, unreliable,
            wasteful and unnecessary capital punishment system, and

            WHEREAS, the death penalty does not deter crime; and

            WHEREAS, the death penalty is imposed in an arbitrary and
            discriminatory manner;

            WHEREAS, there are a growing number of known cases of
            wrongful conviction and increasing evidence that there have
            been wrongful executions; and

            WHEREAS, the death penalty prolongs pain for victims'
            families, dragging them through an agonizing and lengthy
            process that holds out the promise of an execution at the
            beginning but often results in a different sentence in the
            end; and

            WHEREAS, our communities require the best protection and
            convicted murderers must be severely punished; and

            WHEREAS, in the state of Colorado, there are two possible
            sentences for Capital Murder; life without the possibility
            of parole and death. We agree that death should not be an
            option and, therefore, the sentence would be life without
            the possibility of parole.

            THEREFORE, we join the Coloradoans for Alternatives to the
            Death Penalty and others in publicly supporting legislation
            that abolishes the death penalty in our state. We recognize
            that the sole mission of the Coalition is to repeal the
            death penalty in Colorado. We understand that our
            organization will be listed as a member of the Coalition and
            agree to inform our members of our participation and invite
            them to be active in the campaign as part of our efforts
            and/or those of the Coalition or another member
            organization. We acknowledge our right to participate, or to
            not participate, in the meetings and decisions of the
            Coalition. We recognize that any resource implications
            involved in joining the Coalition are entirely voluntary."

            ACTION: We approved signing the resolution letter. We
            suggested that M&O look at this issue and explore further if
            they believe the Meeting should write its own minute.

OLD BUSINESS Signs for religious education and bathrooms. Lisa
volunteered for this last month, but has not accomplished it yet. She
will do this soon, even if they are temporary signs.

b. Do we need a "steward" of the building? ACTION: Nominating Committee
will talk to Peter about the role of this person, and the committee will
draw up a list of responsibilities of this person. NEW BUSINESS a)
Colorado Springs will be the host of the spring gathering of Colorado
Regional Meeting April 28th, 2013, so we will need to think about making
some preparations.

b) A Quaker family from Durango Monthly Meeting will be here on Sunday,
December 9 to worship with us. Their daughter, age 19, is functionally
deaf and they are planning for her to matriculate for one semester at
the State School here in Colorado Springs. They are hopeful of finding
local Quakers to provide support for their daughter and have asked if
there is a family or individual in our meeting who would consider
hosting her for one or two weekends a month between January and May.
ACTION: Bill Wherling's family has volunteered to host this student. We
all think this is wonderful.

ANNOUNCEMENTS Mountain Friends Camp sent a letter of thanks for our
monetary gift, which we have agreed to continue on a regular basis.
