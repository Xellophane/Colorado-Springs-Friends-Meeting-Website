We, Colorado Springs Friends Meeting, Religious Society of Friends, embrace the spirit and
support the goals of the We Divest Campaign of the American Friends Service Committee.

We understand that this campaign was launched in partnership with Jewish Voice for Peace
and that it demands that TIAA-CREF stop investing in corporations that enable the destruction
of Palestinian homes and orchards, the expansion of Israeli settlements and infrastructure,
checkpoint surveillance of Palestinian communities, and provide weapons used against civilians.
The campaign does not ask people to directly divest from TIAA-CREF. Rather it organizes
retirement fund recipients to exercise their rights as shareholders and witness to TIAA-CREF
(a company with $441 billion in assets) to divest from corporations that profit from the military
occupation.

As Friends who value our testimonies of Peace, Equality, Community, Integrity and Simplicity
and strive to live by them, we unite with the AFSC campaign. We see the campaign as an
example of speaking truth to power – in this case to the power of unjust profit – both as
individuals and as a Meeting. We recognize that peace in the Middle East is dependent upon true
justice for Palestinians and so seek to support all nonviolent efforts to further that cause.
