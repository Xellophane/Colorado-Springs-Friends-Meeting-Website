Query on IMYM change in Monthly Meeting Assessment
--------------------------------------------------

1. Meeting affirmed in the positive to these three questions from IMYM:

   A. A $5.00 increase per Friend in the annual IMYM assessment.

   B. A $10.00 increase per Friend to support Mountain Friends Camp (MFC).

   C. Support an increase in 2014 and 2015 to support MFC.

   A Friend asked how are young friends responding to MFC? Very well, and in
   particular with some of our young friends are very active in MFC with 
   Quetzal being an active supporter and advocate for MFC including giving
   presentations in support of MFC.

   Another Friend asked about the age range for MFC? The age range is from 12-17,
   with any Friends older than 17 can become cousoulers at MFC.

Minutes for Seasoning
---------------------

2. In the IMYM Query regarding the Proposed Minute opposing Torture, Friends felt
   we should season this query to arrive at a minute. We as Quakers would support a minute that
   opposes violences in any form. The Adult Education and Action was commended to create
   the wording for proposed Minute and action for the Meeting.

3. Pima Minute on Occupy. Friends expressed that the last few sentences in the Pima minute could
   be removed without changing their intent of the minute. Other Friends expressed concerns about
   timeliness of this minute and that they don't necessarily support all of the actions being 
   done by individuals identified with the Occupy movements. Finally, Friends encouraged IMYM to
   write a minute on the Occupy movement with "prose in the spirit of Friends".
