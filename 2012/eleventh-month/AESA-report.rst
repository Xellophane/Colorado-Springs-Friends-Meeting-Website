REPORT OF THE ACTION COMMITTEE
==============================
 
Dear Colorado Springs Friends:
 
We have received notice from Eric Smith of Mountain View Friends Meeting that he is led to work with Friends Meetings all over Colorado, (including Durango and Colorado Regional) to consider approving a minute to support ending the death penalty in Colorado by signing on to a letter drafted by Coloradoans Against the Death Penalty (CACP). He has suggested that if our meeting needs some dialogue around the issue he can come at our invitation along with a member of CACP to make a presentation. My sense, from the reaction to the announcement we made at Meeting for Worship yesterday, is that Colorado Springs Friends are already pretty much on board with this.
 
Attached to this email is a copy of the CACP draft letter and the approved resolution against the death penalty accepted by Mountain View Friends Meeting.
 
Our task at Meeting for Worship for Business this coming First Day will be to see if we can come to unity around signing on to the letter and adopting the Mountain View statement as our own, or do we want to draft our own statement to add to the letter? Also, if any Friends wish to have Eric and the CACP representative come to make a presentation, we will need to discuss that as well.
 
On the Light, Genie Durland, Clerk
