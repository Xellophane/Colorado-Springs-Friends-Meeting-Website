Finance Committee Minutes
=========================

May 15, 2012 at 5:15 at The Herman Group offices
------------------------------------------------
Present: `Sarah Callbeck`_ (Clerk and Bookkeeper), `Ann Daugherty`_ and 
`Lisa Lister`_ (Treasurer and Recorder).

We opened with silence.

Our listing in Friends Journal ended up costing an additional $22 because 
the inclusion of our web site address added an additional line.

`Lisa`_ has been paying the mortgage by check, but will contact our 
lender to see if we can move to billpay or some other automatic method.

We discussed the big picture implications of owning a property, i.e. the need for reserving
money for yearly insurance payments and ongoing maintenance. Although we have a prudent
reserve, we need to have a large chunk of it available should we need to replace the furnace. We
will be closely monitoring our cash flow and expenses for the next few months to make sure we
are bringing in enough revenue to cover our monthly expenses:

Mortgage $477
Utilities $200 (average per month estimate)
Insurance premium $99
TOTAL $776

In light of changes to our expenses, the `Finance Committee`_ plans to 
redo the Meeting's budget and present it at the June business meeting.

We would like to ask those who made a monthly pledge to the building fund 
if it is now OK to use this money for current Meeting needs, such as 
mortgage and utilities.

In the Light,

`Lisa Lister`_
