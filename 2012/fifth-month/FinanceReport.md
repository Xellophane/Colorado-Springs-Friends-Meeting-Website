Finance Committee Minutes
=========================

May 15, 2012 at 5:15 at The Herman Group offices
------------------------------------------------

Present: [Sarah Callbeck](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) (Clerk and
Bookkeeper), [Ann Daugherty](/Friends/AnnDaugherty/) and [Lisa
Lister](/Friends/LisaLister/) (Treasurer and Recorder).

We opened with silence.

Our listing in Friends Journal ended up costing an additional \$22
because the inclusion of our web site address added an additional line.

[Lisa](/Friends/LisaLister/) has been paying the mortgage by check, but
will contact our lender to see if we can move to billpay or some other
automatic method.

We discussed the big picture implications of owning a property, i.e. the
need for reserving money for yearly insurance payments and ongoing
maintenance. Although we have a prudent reserve, we need to have a large
chunk of it available should we need to replace the furnace. We will be
closely monitoring our cash flow and expenses for the next few months to
make sure we are bringing in enough revenue to cover our monthly
expenses:

Mortgage \$477 Utilities \$200 (average per month estimate) Insurance
premium \$99 TOTAL \$776

In light of changes to our expenses, the [Finance
Committee](/committees/Finance/) plans to redo the Meeting's budget and
present it at the June business meeting.

We would like to ask those who made a monthly pledge to the building
fund if it is now OK to use this money for current Meeting needs, such
as mortgage and utilities.

In the Light,

[Lisa Lister](/Friends/LisaLister/)

Finance Committee Recorder
