      Implications of owning building includes having a enough in reserve for a new furnace

      cover insurance payments. 
      
      `Genie`_  said that something needs to be done about the building acoustics that 
      need to be addressed in the very near future. `Meeting House`_ committee should take
      up this issue. `Meeting House`_ committee will contact `Finance Committee`_ about
      costs.
      
      Immediate things to adjust in the budget are $477 for mortgage, utilities $200 a month,       
      insurance premium, $99 a month for a total $776.00 outflow.

      *Question to Business Meeting*: Ask Friends if dedicated building pledges can 
      end of May by the beginning of June. Committee will contact meeting, `Lisa`_ will
      be sending out an email to other Friends requesting change in donation. Let donors 
      decide about. Finance Committee we have a lot of needs, asking those who designated
      building funds to more general Meeting funds. The letter the committee is sending
      out will include details about this request. Would like to have flexibility before
      starting new budget.

      are coordinating landscaping. `Molly`_ is going off committee and she is interested
      in the long-term of health of this project. We need more people, `Molly`_ encourage
      friends to volunteer. Report two very good volunteer days in the past month. Had
      11-12 people on clean-up day. 6-8 people for moving day. `Molly`_ happy that when
      call goes out, friends responds.
      
      Murphy Construction is finishing up some minor things, but have substantially 
      
      `Ann`_ has agreed to be the contact person for all contractor. She is working with
      the building's previous owners insurance company to pay for the roof. The previous
      owner's insurance company is putting some limits but `Ann`_ and lawyer are working
      on this matter. The roof determined to be priority when we moved in; committee needs
      to figure this out because the roof is in bad shape.
      
      Do we have $1,500 for the roof, it may require this additional amount. `Molly`_ asking
      about heating/cooling priorities for Meeting? Reserve money for replacing the heater
      if we don't include air conditioning. $8,000 in waiting with $2,000 in Calvert. We
      are very happy to report that initial work to make this building safe is completed
      and came under budget. We have smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and new electrical
      work.
      
      Look in June meeting for a revised estimate/recommendation for prudent reserve to 
      cover replacing heater minus air conditioning? Friends will determine what to with
      prudent 
      
      `Sarah`_ request that as soon as new revised furnace reserves numbers be forward
      to Fiance committee. `Jennifer`_ is interested in internal decorating and acoustics
      and joining the committee.
      
      `Molly`_ suggested to help address the acoustic issues by shrinking the size of the
      circle to a double circle and adding another rug. An email be send out about Friends
      Acoustics are an urgent priority, look at temporary measures until a permanent solution

      Genie is unclear where Friends can meet for the education committee. For the time
      being, the main room's acoustics will make it hard to run a class for now meet in

      is also for Ginger's going away 9:30 memorial service and roll into Meeting for 
      Worship at 10:00 with the party afterwards. 
     
      `Genie`_ asked if we should a dedicated time during Meeting for Worship for late 
      friends to come into the meeting. For next week, request Friends to wait until
      memorial service is finished, before coming into the Meeting for Worship. 
      
      `Carlton`_ wondered about expectations of DeeDee's family for memorial services and
      should be an hour and start at 9:00? Is Memorial service a formal Memorial Meeting?
      Yes. `Martha`_ will be consulting with DeeDee family about their desires. 
      
      Balance between openness and hospitality but still encourage Friends to arrive on 
      time. Need balance between the two and M&O will take this matter for consideration.
      
      Coordinate with DeeDee's family about options of first having Meeting for Worship. Maybe
      if we could have a different day of the week for DeeDee's memorial? `Martha`_ will
      be following up with DeeDee's family about their wishes. Maybe Saturday or Monday?
      `Ginger`_ will ask the family. 
      
   c. June's Business Meeting is scheduled when people are coming back from IMYM. 
      Should be 10th or 17th? `Molly`_ won't be here on the 17th, `Ginger`_ recommends
      that Meeting for Business on the 10th. Friends are encouraged to send committee
      reports by Monday or Tuesday.

      designs can modified.  Meeting House committee will undertake this matter. 
      
      `Bill`_ added that Quaker Meeting traditionally open to other groups including
      neighbors, to use the space. `Carlton`_ asked if we should have an open house for 
      this neighborhood? Yes, and another matter for the Meeting House committee for 
      consideration.
