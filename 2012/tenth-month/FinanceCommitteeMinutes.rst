Finance Committee Minutes
=========================
:Date: $Date: 2012-10-16 11:24:00 +0000 (, 16 October 2012) $

Present: `Sarah Callbeck`_ (clerk), `Ann Daugherty`_, and `Lisa Lister`_ 
(Treasurer and Recording clerk).

We are still waiting for an invoice from Fountain Valley Electric for the 
installation of baseboards in the bathrooms and basement, and the addition 
of two outlets in the basement.  `Ann`_ will follow-up.

We reviewed the Cash Flow report, which was excellent as usual.  It is 
clear that we have little money left for additional improvements and 
furnishings without increasing our coffers.

`Lisa`_ will check with the Friends Meeting House Fund to make sure that 
they received our grant application, and to find out when they will deliberate.

It is time to prepare and send out stewardship (pledge) letters, asking 
members and attenders to make a financial commitment to the Meeting for the next 
budget year.  An estimate of projected revenues is essential so that the `Finance Committee`_ 
can propose a 2013 budget.  Lisa will work on re-writing the letter, as much has 
changed since a year ago!  Before sending it, she will send the draft to `Molly`_ and the 
other `Finance Committee`_ members for review.

We agreed to move accrued funds for assessments and insurance in the checking account 
over to savings for safe-keeping until payment is due.


In the Light,

`Lisa Lister`_
Recording Clerk
