nce Committee Minutes
10-16-2012

Present: Sarah Callbeck (clerk), Ann Daugherty, and Lisa Lister (Treasurer and Recording clerk).

We are still waiting for an invoice from Fountain Valley Electric for the installation of baseboards in the bathrooms and basement, and the addition of two outlets in the basement.  Ann will follow-up.

We reviewed the Cash Flow report, which was excellent as usual.  It is clear that we have little money left for additional improvements and furnishings without increasing our coffers.

Lisa will check with the Friends Meeting House Fund to make sure that they received our grant application, and to find out when they will deliberate.

It is time to prepare and send out stewardship (pledge) letters, asking members and attenders to make a financial commitment to the Meeting for the next budget year.  An estimate of projected revenues is essential so that the Finance Committee can propose a 2013 budget.  Lisa will work on re-writing the letter, as much has changed since a year ago!  Before sending it, she will send the draft to Molly and the other Finance Committee members for review.

We agreed to move accrued funds for assessments and insurance in the checking account over to savings for safe-keeping until payment is due.


In the Light,

Lisa Lister
Recording Clerk
