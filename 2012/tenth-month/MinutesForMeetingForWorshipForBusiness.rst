=========================================================
:Date: $Date: 2012-10-21 11:22:00 +0000 (Sun, 21 October 2012) $
Tenth month, 2012

Present: `Ann`_, `Bill`_, `Genie`_, `Sarah`_, `Carlton`_, `Lisa`_ (acting recording clerk) 
and `Jeremy`_ (acting clerk).

We opened with silence.  `Jeremy`_ read a passage from **The Heart of Aikido: The Philosophy of Takemusu 
Aiki** by Morihei Ueshiba.

Approval of September Minutes
-----------------------------
We approved the September minutes, with corrections suggested by Sarah.

**Cash Flow Report** (attached) was reviewed by Sarah accepted with thanks.

Clerk's report
--------------
The Open House was fun, and the Clerk supports `Bill Werling`_'s suggestion that 
we hold one every six months.
		
`Carlton`_'s Show and Tell:  It looks like most people would be able to attend 
an evening event on Monday or Friday night.  Several people would be willing to 
talk about what they do and several just wanted to listen.  Molly will schedule 
the event in November or December.


Committee Reports
-----------------
A. Finance Committee (`attached </committees/Finance/2012/10/>`_)

   Will be paying for work done by Fountain Valley for baseboard heaters in 
   the bathrooms and outlets in the basement.  This has now been paid.  
   Stewardship letters will go out soon.  We are setting aside assessments and 
   insurance payments in a separate account, so we have this money available to 
   pay these items when they come due.  The report was gratefully accepted.

B. Nominating Committee
   
   `Genie Durland`_ has agreed to return to Nominating for a while in the 
   absence of `Jonathan McPhee`_. `Bill Werling`_ will remain on the committee. 
   We approved `Genie`_ as a new member. 

C. Ministry and Oversight
 
   This committee has not met since August, but will meet soon. `Bill`_ wondered if 
   we need to designate specific people as "early comers" to make certain that the 
   meeting house is open a bit before 10:00.  (Today there were visitors, and the 
   Meeting House was not yet open).  No decision was made, but perhaps M&O could consider?

D. Adult Religious Education and Action Committee

   `Genie`_ had agreed to be the AFSC liaison, and in the role, will bring information 
   to the Meeting.  The "We Divest" campaign (boycott/divestment actions) one issue that 
   AFSC is concerned with.  They suggest that Meetings consider writing a minute of support 
   about this issue. Attached is a more detailed report which was sent to Colorado Regional.  
   `Genie`_ will draft a minute regarding support of AFSC’s campaign which we will consider 
   for approval at the Eleventh Month Business Meeting.   The Clerk of Finance Committee 
   (`Sarah`_) will write a letter to Friends Fiduciary thanking them for their divestment.

E. First Day School report

   `Sarah`_ reports that on Nov. 4 there will be a First Day School parent and child 
   meeting/pizza party at the Meeting House. 

F. Meeting Home Committee (`attached <committees/MeetingHouse/2012/10/>`_)

   Progress on various building projects was reported. 

   We approved having another open house in April.  There was reluctance expressed to 
   do this permanently every six months, but those present felt that another Open House 
   would be good.

   If anyone has an extra space heater, we could use another one in the basement.

   Those present felt that the acoustics are better, although not optimal.

   The FGC Friends Meeting House Fund has received our application for grant money to help 
   cover the cost of a new furnace.  They will meet on Nov. 17, so we should be hearing 
   news soon.  In addition, `Molly`_ has approached Fort Collins Meeting about a potential 
   matching grant.

   We received a tax bill for the property.  Brian Murphy and `Ann`_ are working on 
   getting an exempt status from the state.   The fee to do this will be $175.

G. Library Report
   
   `Joyce`_ has put new labels in all our library books with our new address.


Other discussion
----------------
We discussed the fact that a visitor went down into the basement during Meeting 
looking for the bathroom.  `Lisa`_ will make two signs: One for the bathrooms 
and one for "Religious Education."

Do we need a "steward" of the building, especially once we have other groups 
using the building?  There are times when the building will be used without charge, 
such as an event or group that is an extension of the Meeting’s work (such as the 
War Tax resisters).

`Bill`_ commented that the Meeting seems to be in accord with one another when 
it comes to the new Meeting House, and we are all grateful for this equanimity. 


New Business
------------
`Genie`_ wondered if we should email guests and just thank them for coming. (They 
visited Palo Alto Meeting, and they received an email later, which they felt was 
very kind).  `Ann`_ has agreed to do this for the Meeting.


Announcements
-------------
`Jeremy`_ plans to go live with our new web site in mid-November. `Jeremy`_ will 
send a link out for everyone to review.  He would appreciate your comments and 
suggestions.  People can have their own pages if they like, so if you want to send 
`Jeremy`_ information about yourself for your personal page, please do.

We closed in silence.

In the Light,

`Lisa Lister`_
