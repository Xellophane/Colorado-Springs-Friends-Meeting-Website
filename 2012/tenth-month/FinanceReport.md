Finance Committee Minutes
=========================

Present: [Sarah Callbeck](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) (clerk), [Ann
Daugherty](/Friends/AnnDaugherty/), and [Lisa
Lister](/Friends/LisaLister/) (Treasurer and Recording clerk).

We are still waiting for an invoice from Fountain Valley Electric for
the installation of baseboards in the bathrooms and basement, and the
addition of two outlets in the basement. [Ann](/Friends/AnnDaugherty/)
will follow-up.

We reviewed the Cash Flow report, which was excellent as usual. It is
clear that we have little money left for additional improvements and
furnishings without increasing our coffers.

[Lisa](/Friends/LisaLister/) will check with the Friends Meeting House
Fund to make sure that they received our grant application, and to find
out when they will deliberate.

It is time to prepare and send out stewardship (pledge) letters, asking
members and attenders to make a financial commitment to the Meeting for
the next budget year. An estimate of projected revenues is essential so
that the [Finance Committee](/committees/Finance/) can propose a 2013
budget. Lisa will work on re-writing the letter, as much has changed
since a year ago! Before sending it, she will send the draft to
[Molly](/Friends/MollyWingate/) and the other [Finance
Committee](/committees/Finance/) members for review.

We agreed to move accrued funds for assessments and insurance in the
checking account over to savings for safe-keeping until payment is due.

In the Light,

[Lisa Lister](/Friends/LisaLister/)

Recording Clerk
