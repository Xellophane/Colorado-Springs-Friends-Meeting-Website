Emeeting with input from `Ann Daugherty`_ (clerk), 
`Molly Wingate`_, `Daniel Kidney`_, and from finance 
committee members `Sarah Callbeck`_ and `Lisa Lister`_.

We have a big decision to make on Sunday, if we can come to unity.  
The Meeting House Committee offers two possibilities for replacing 
our heater so that we have adequate heater upstairs and downstairs.  

Meeting House and Finance Committees have been collecting bids and working over 
our finances and here are the proposals. With both of these proposals, the 
Finance Committee would have a prudent reserve, but not if we spend more than option #1.

1. 92% efficient heater with A/C and all duct work for $11,512.61

2. 92% heater and all duct work with ceiling fans and insulation in the attic:   
   8453.90 + $770 (LIGHTS AND FANS) + $1350 (insulation in attic) = $10,573

We have the opportunity to take advantage of 2012 prices if we can come to unity.  
Also we will have the opportunity to have a discount on the A/C if we do the 
heater and A/C at the same time.  

A few commented that ceiling fans and insulation are prudent and eco-friendly 
projects to make the most of our new heater and might do enough to cool the worship space.

A few mentioned that we are more likely to be able to rent the meeting 
house to others if we have A/C.

We were reminded that the Friends General Conference Meeting House Fund encouraged 
us to ask for money again, so if we find we need A/C, we have a potential funding 
source. We could also ask for money for fans, rewiring the lights, and insulation.
