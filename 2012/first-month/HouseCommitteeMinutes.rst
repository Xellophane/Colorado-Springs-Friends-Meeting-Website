In  attendance:  `Carlton Gamer`_, `Ann Daugherty`_, `Molly Wingate`_


1. We hope to set up a regular meeting time and place and to get everyone there.  
   It is suggested that we meet on the 4th Wednesday of the Month at 1 PM at `Carlton`_’s house.  
   We will see if that works.
2. `Ann Daugherty`_ will be our clerk and `Molly Wingate`_ will be our recording clerk.
3. We have some questions for the meeting at large to add to its consideration of its readiness to 
   have a meetinghouse.
   a. What do the testimonies lead us to look for?
   b. We created the following list of contrasts to help move the conversation along.

|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|   
| Do we want to rent? (easy to get out)    | Do we want to own? (build equity)       |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Do we want to simply meet on Sunday?     | Do we want more participation in other  |
|                                          | activities during the week?             |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Do we prefer not to think/talk about     | Are we willing to take on the financial |
| money for a building?                    | responsibilities of a meeting house, it |
|                                          | utilities, and maintenance?             |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Do we want casual programming?           | Do we want deliberate programming       | 
|                                          | including a regular 1st Day school,     |
|                                          | discussion groups, study groups,        | 
|                                          | Hospitality, hosting larger Quaker      | 
|                                          | gatherings and community project?       |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Do we want a temporary location          | Do we want a permanent location?        |
| for  2 – 5 years?                        |                                         |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|


4. We decided to continue to look at buildings and lots as they come up so we stay abreast of changes 
   and opportunities.  But we feel we can’t move on anything without some clear direction from 
   the meeting.
5. If and when we have such clarity, we suggest that the meeting and the committee put together 
   some parameters for writing a contract.  To be able to quickly deliver a contract would greatly 
   increase the chances of the meeting being able to take advantage of opportunities.   `Ann`_ 
   agreed to create a list of decisions that we might be able to make in advance.  We would include a 
   contingency that the building and the “deal” meet with the approval of the meeting. 
6. We went to look at a church built in 1915 at `950 E. Cimarron`_ that is for sale for $95,000.  It 
   is a pristine, historic building, and we liked it.  The price is affordable to us, and we can work 
   out financing through the seller.  It is still in use and we could start meeting there with very 
   little renovation. We decided to seek clerk `Ginger Morgan`_’s guidance about bringing this opportunity 
   to the meeting.  Since we have so many conversations about getting a meeting house planned, we wonder 
   if we should just let this opportunity pass.  `Ann`_ will contact `Ginger`_.
7.  Molly will get all this information to Julie and see if our meeting time will work.

Respectfully submitted,
`Molly Wingate`_
Recording clerk for Meeting Home
