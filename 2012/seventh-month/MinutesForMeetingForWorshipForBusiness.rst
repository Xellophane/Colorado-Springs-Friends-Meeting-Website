1. Approval of June Minutes - approved with changes.

2. Cash Flow Reports

   Reports distributed 7/11. Clerk asked if there is preference for how
   cash flow report is read at Business Meeting, full report or highlights?
   We encouraged finance clerk just related the highlight and it is not 
   necessary to read entire report.

   Pretty unanimous among Friends, redirect all funds targeted to building fund to
   general fund.  Current ending balance at the end of June. $3,294.74 cents in 
   checking account. At the moment we are trending water and holding stable.

   Small building fund deposit portion to pledge, the current total savings includes 
   emergency reserves $2,907.89. The amount remaining in the building fund, a Ent saving 
   $2,314.53, 1,400 left of Meeting House projects, roof payment. Sarah took all 
   contributions to building funds at the end of April are all. Prudent reserve, 
   some money has gone into the building fund, difference between 2,300 
   and 1,400 is mortgage reserve. We have $400 dollars left over for building house projects. We are
   still buying supplies. After July's expenses, likely down to 300 for Building House
   fund. We are always going to try to keep about $10,000 in prudent emergency reserves.
   
   Molly would like to celebrate the fact that two major issues for the Meeting House, 
   the roof and the furnace, pause and reflect how great it is that we as the small
   Meeting able to support. 

   The Meeting accepts the cash flow with gratitude.   


3. Committee Reports:

      Item action - there was a concern about the process of renting out the [finance committee 
      report]. Any number of issues surrounding renting out Meeting House reports, Meeting House
      committee also discussed. `Molly`_ thoughts we are not ready to rent, until we have up to
      code and safe heat in the bathrooms, we are not ready for renting. There are sorts of things
      we are involved that we could bring meetings here. We don't have the storage capacity to 
      support renting out space. Encourage Friends to how we can use the Meeting House for our 
      events? We don't have enough chairs to support, `Molly`_ so thankful to `Sarah`_ about
      keeping this issue mindful.

      worship. `Molly`_ feels that right now we don't have problem, still keep this
      matter to discuss? `Joyce`_ wonders if Friend coming to the door and sit at 
      outside of meeting. Ad hoc, easy solution, pass responsibility around over time.
      Super easy to do, and not have long-term commitment. Maybe week-by-week or monthly.
      Sign on "greeter chair", striving for simplicity. `Molly`_ doesn't have a problem
      with more of a long term commitment likes the idea of greeter. Concern or commit
