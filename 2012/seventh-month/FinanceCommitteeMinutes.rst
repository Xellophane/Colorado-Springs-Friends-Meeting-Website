July 10, 2012 

Present: `Sarah Callbeck`_ (Clerk and Bookkeeper), `Ann Daugherty`_ and 
`Lisa Lister`_ (Treasurer and Recorder).


Mid-Year Letters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Mid-year letters to those who pledged will be sent out soon. `Sarah`_ is having printer problems, 
so `Ann`_ will print and mail them.

Secure Mailbox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We discussed the need for a secure mailbox at the Meetinghouse, so we can begin transitioning 
from using our P.O. Box.  `Ann`_ will look into costs.  We will need at least two keys – one for the 
clerk and one for the treasurer.

Furnace Quote
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We still need an exact quote for a new furnace, so that we are ready to proceed with 
installation before winter.  `Ann`_ will follow-up.

Colorado Regional Assessments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`Lisa`_ is still aware that we have not yet paid our assessments to Colorado Regional.  She has 
been emailing different people on and off since February, but has never been able to get a 
treasurer's address to send the check to.  We have never been billed.  She plans to pay when 
Colorado Regional comes to our Meeting in a few weeks.

Roofing Cost
^^^^^^^^^^^^
We also discussed the payment of an additional $1,000 to cover roofing expenses.  `Lisa`_ will pay 
from our existing Meetinghouse reserve as soon as she receives the payment details.

Thinking about Renting 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There was a concern from members of the Finance Committee that we begin the process of 
thinking about how to go about renting out the space to others, including how much to charge.  
We decided that this is an all-Meeting discussion, and suggest, with input from the broader 
Meeting, that an existing committee or a new committee be charged with thinking about 
specifics and developing a plan.

We also reviewed the Cash Flow Report, and then closed in silence.

In the Light,

`Lisa`_
Finance Committee recorder
