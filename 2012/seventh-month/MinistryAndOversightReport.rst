Meeting opened in spiritual silence.

Proposed agenda approved: (Minutes are approved by email between meetings for Monthly
business and submitted to it, excepting confidential matters.)

1. Consultation with Val Phillips concerning her 

   1) transfer of membership and 
   
   2) request that Gardner Worship Group come under the care of our meeting.
   
2. Draft mission statement approval

3. Individual reports on progress of annual phone calls.

`Peter LeVar`_ volunteered to record the draft minutes of this meeting.

The M&O meeting met at the home of `Bill`_ and `Genie Durland`_ with 
`Val Phillips`_ and constituted itself as a clearness committee for both 
`Val`_ and the committee in consultation to determine the extent of 
clarity now existing between our committee, `Val`_ and the Gardner 
Worship Group.

Each of us present shared our experiences with transfers and worship 
groups after we introduced ourselves to `Val`_ and `Val`_ to us and 
listened to Val’s opening comments.

1. Transfer: Val has not yet requested the transfer of her membership 
   from Mountain View Monthly Meeting to Colorado Springs Monthly Meeting, 
   due to the overload of farm work at her community this time of year. 
   We shared with `Val`_ our recommendation at our last meeting of M&O 
   that the meeting approve the initiation of the transfer process from
   Mountain View to Colorado Springs. Our business meeting of June 10 
   did not act upon that recommendation. The sense of the M&O meeting 
   for clearness is that no further action will be taken on our part 
   until the necessary steps in Quaker transfer process are completed.
   
2. Worship Group: `Val`_ shared with us the present status of the Gardner 
   Worship Group, providing valuable information for a future decision on 
   our relationship with it. Our business meeting on June 10 requested 
   that M&O wait on any decision to take Gardner Worship Group under our 
   care until the transfer process is complete. `Val`_ also expressed her 
   reservations on any immediate decision required. Val is the only Quaker 
   member of the worship group. Other Quakers nearby attend from time to 
   time, as does her husband, interns and visitors. The sense of the meeting 
   is that we put off her question to take the worship group under our 
   care until the transfer process is completed. (At this point consultants 
   and visitor withdrew with deep appreciation for their presence and the
   clearness committee status came to an end.)
   
3. Mission Statement: The mission statement, after discussion, was approved 
   and is attached to this report for the business meeting’s information.
   
4. Status of Phone Calls: Phone calls are still in process. Our expectation 
   is to complete them as the way opens by our July meeting.

Respectfully submitted on behalf of the M&O committee members and consultants 
and with a copy forwarded to `Val Phillips`_ for any further comments she 
wishes to add, by its Clerk, `Bill Durland`_ to the Colorado Springs next 
Meeting for Worship for Business.
