   d. IMYM Directory available by request, 
      
      One Meeting Clerk has asked me if it's ok to forward the 
      electronic copies to everyone on her Meeting email list. 
      Although this has not been discussed at Continuing Committee, 
      I suggested to her that that was not a good idea; it might be 
      interpreted as "okaying" general distribution to those not members or 
      active attenders of Meetings. I suggested instead that we only send it 
      to individuals in each Meeting who request it.

      Ed Kearns, Chair, IMYM Directory Committee

Respectfully submitted in the light,

Jeremy Nelson
