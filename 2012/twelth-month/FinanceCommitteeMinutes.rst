Present: Sarah Callbeck (clerk), Ann Daugherty, and Lisa Lister (treasurer and recording clerk).
We met at Lisa’s house.

Before Sarah arrived, Ann and Lisa discussed the idea of Sarah becoming bookkeeper for the meeting.  The job pays $60 a month and is budgeted.  We believe that Sarah would be the perfect person for this position because of her intimate knowledge of our finances.  She has already spent many years and countless hours setting up our books, preparing budgets, and faithfully stewarding the Meeting’s resources.  We recommend that the Meeting approve Sarah for this position.

This month we have $100 for local distributions.  An updated list is attached.

The treasurer will pay FGC $100, which is our annual donation.

We reviewed the draft budget for 2013, and thank Sarah profusely for her dedication and hard work in preparing it.  The bottom line (projected revenue minus projected expenses) reveals a modest shortfall, and although concerning, we feel it is not serious.  Hope springs eternal!  We seek approval from the Meeting for the 2013 budget.

We reviewed the cash flow report.

We discussed what funds are available to purchase a new furnace, AC, fans and insulation, as the Meetinghouse Committee is considering how to proceed.  Ann will convey this information back to the Meetinghouse Committee, so they can make a recommendation to the Meeting.

We discussed the concept of keeping a certain amount of cash available in permanent reserve as a financial safety net.  We are striving toward accruing a six month permanent reserve for mortgage and utilities.  We are trying to maintain a $2,000 checking account balance at all times, but this is not always possible.

The Committee wishes to remind members and attenders that an end-of-year donation to the Meeting would be welcome!


In the Light,

Lisa Lister
Recording Clerk
