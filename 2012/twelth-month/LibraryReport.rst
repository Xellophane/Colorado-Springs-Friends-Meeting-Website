2. Activity
In March 2011 the library replaced the file card checkout system with the use of a checkout log
book for easy recording of the borrower’s name, book title, phone number, check out and in
dates. Previously, we had no way of determining how much the library was being used. With the
log book we can report 9 books were checked out in 2011 and 7 in 2012. While these numbers
are small, they are three to four times as in 2010. Now, in our new meeting home with room to
spread out our growing collection and to browse, our library is easily accessible.
3. Organization
With the donation of a bookcase with widely spaced shelves, we now have an area to keep
many oversized materials that were previously in storage or in the file cabinet (see the Inventory
listing: Oversized Materals). Magazine holders allow us to have a year or more of Friends
Journal, Western Friend and newsletters close at hand for easy reference or browsing. The file
3
cabinet holds the older copies and other materials as noted in the inventory under Periodicals
and Newsletters.
The Non-Violence sections--Conscientious Objection, War-tax Resistance and Conflict
Resolution--are now subsections under the heading Peace & Justice Concerns. Many titles in
the Christianity & Miscellaneous section are moved to the Peace & Justice Concerns section
under the subsection: General. The Christianity & Miscellaneous section is further divided into
four sections: Christianity, World Religions, World History, Miscellaneous.
4. Inventory
The library will maintain the Inventory List on Google Doc and print hard copies as needed.
Hard copies are located in Library Inventory (narrow white) binder in Oversized Materials, with
the checkout log, and in folder with Children/Youth’s Curriculum. It seems appropriate and
useful to make the Inventory available on our website and propose that this be done when
possible. The Card Catalog will not be continued, but retained in the file cabinet (that is, not
discarded).
The previous two inventories, 2009 and 2010, were followed by a list of items “not checked
out but missing” from the collection, however the items were left in the inventory list without
note they were missing. The 2012 Inventory List, instead, indicates the missing items with an
asterisk, without the following list of missing items. Such a list can be assembled if it becomes
necessary.
5. Checked out items
The following items have been checked out but not returned. If you are finished with them,
please return:
Title Checked out by & Date
Jane Addams & Hull House Carolyn Kuban 11/20/11
Quaker Profiles & Practices Katherine Fatica 5/6/12
6. Recommendations
1. As mentioned above, include inventory on our website.
2. Acquire, through donation or purchase, titles by our members/attenders which pertain to
Quaker values/concerns.

Respectfully submitted,
Joyce Doyle
