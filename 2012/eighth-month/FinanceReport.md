Finance Committee Meeting Minutes
=================================
E-Meeting held 8-13 through 8-15

Sarah analyzed the cost of utilities since we moved into the property.  It 
shows larger usage in the months of remodel, then a decrease when the building 
was only used for meeting for worship and meetinghouse committee.  This is heartening.

The 2012 Checking account balance is also heartening as it shows a slow 
increase over the last two months.  Sarah will continue to track this as 
it's a useful tool for determining if we're living within our means.

Regarding roofing payment:  Ann reported that Church Mutual insisted they had not 
received the Reynolds Roofing System invoice.  Jeanette Dorland of the Church of 
Christ and Ann finally found the correct representative.  Jeanette received the 
check from Church Mutual; she deposited it and wrote a check on the Church of 
Christ account in the amount of $1699.88. It appears the balance due Reynolds 
Roofing Systems is $752.48. This was paid by the Meeting on 8-16-2012.

The Mailbox: Ann purchased the type that real estate agents use to drop off 
contracts with earnest money checks. Ann is donating the $65.00 cost plus tax rate 
of 7.652% ($4.97).  Thank you, Ann.  We hope to stop paying the cost of our P.O. 
box by the end of year.

Gutters:  Ann also donated the installation and cost of the gutters, which was $771.00.  
Thank you (very much) again, Ann!


Upcoming expenses:

We received a quote from Fountain Valley Electric for the cost of putting in outlets in the 
First Day School Room and for electric heaters in restrooms, including a baseboard heater in the 
storage room.  The amount is $1,170.  We have this money available.  The Meeting needs to 
decide if they want to proceed with the baseboard heat item, or if we can get by without it.  
Some people have concerns about the safety of this kind of heat system in a room which stores 
potentially flammable liquids.

Quote for furnace replacements from American Comfort:
The cost to replace both existing units with one Bryant 92% efficient furnace and all duct work 
with venting is $8,453.90 this price does not include electrical. To add air conditioning would 
be $3,664.64. (If combined, we can save 5% of the total).  This price does not include 
electrical, and a panel upgrade is needed for air conditioning.  The Meeting needs to consider 
whether the addition of air conditioning is something that we should proceed with.  It may make 
the building more rentable, and may also make the building more comfortable in the summer for our 
own activities.  Lisa is in the process of submitting a grant request to the FGC Friends Meeting 
House Fund to cover a portion of the cost of the furnace.  Before she sends in the application, 
she would like to know if our preference in the furnace/AC combination.  We will not hear back 
from them until November.  The Meeting currently has $8,000 at Calvert that has been earmarked for 
the furnace.

In the Light,

Lisa, 
Finance Committee Treasurer and Recorder
