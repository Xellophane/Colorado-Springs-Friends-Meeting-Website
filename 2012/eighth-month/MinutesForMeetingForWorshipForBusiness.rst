   Colorado Regional Meeting will be in Estes Park (October 19-21) is going to 
   focus on the diversity in our own spiritual community as Quakers...  
  
   "How do you experience living a spirit-led life?  Would you be willing to 
   share your experience?  How would you be willing to share it? Would you 
   be willing to be interviewed?  Do you express your spirituality creatively
   ... e.g., music, dance, other ways?"
 
   You will soon be able to find the registration form at IMYM.org under the 
   Colorado Regional folder.
