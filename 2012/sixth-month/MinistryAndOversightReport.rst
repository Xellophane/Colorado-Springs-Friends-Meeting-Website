Meeting of May 25, 2012
-----------------------
Presented June 10, 2012 to Colorado Springs Friends Meeting for Worship for Business
 
Attending: `Bill Durland`_, Clerk, `Martha Lutz`_ and 
`Carlton Gamer`_ and `Genie Durland`_ as consultants,
 
Meeting opened with spiritual silence

Proposed minutes and agenda accepted (there was no meeting in April due to some members unable to attend)

Old Business: 

An update on phone calls to members and attenders was submitted. We will 
report further in June, complete calls in July and summarize our findings.

* Memorial(s) are in process and in Clerkâ€™s hands. Martha will continue oversight.

New Business: 

* A mission statement will be drafted with IMYM language as its basis, 
  accompanied by an appendix on annual calendar events as requested by 
  the incoming Clerk.
  
* A lengthy discussion was held on `Val Phillips`_'s request for 

  1. transfer of membership from Mountain View Meeting 
  
  2. Gardner Worship Group coming under the care of Colorado Springs Meeting.
  
  Recommendations: `Val Phillips`_' membership transfer request should 
  be approved. Her second request on behalf of Gardner Worship Group is 
  taken under advisement pending input from June Meeting for Worship for 
  Business to determine what questions and comments we should convey to 
  `Val`_ on behalf of the Meeting. (M&O Clerk has contacted `Val`_ on 
  these matters, and she has been asked to attend the June M&O meeting.)
 
There being no further business before the committee we ended in spiritual 
silence and in appreciation for our consultation with `Carlton`_ and `Genie`_.
 
In the Light of the Spirit,
 
`Bill Durland`_, M&O Clerk, for `Martha Lutz`_, member 
And `Carlton Gamer`_ and `Genie Durland`_, consultants
