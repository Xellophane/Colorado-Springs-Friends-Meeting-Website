Meeting opened with spiritual silence

Proposed minutes and agenda accepted (there was no meeting in April due
to some members unable to attend)

Old Business:

An update on phone calls to members and attenders was submitted. We will
report further in June, complete calls in July and summarize our
findings.

-   Memorial(s) are in process and in Clerkâ€™s hands. Martha will
    continue oversight.

New Business:

-   A mission statement will be drafted with IMYM language as its basis,
    accompanied by an appendix on annual calendar events as requested by
    the incoming Clerk.

-   A lengthy discussion was held on [Val
    Phillips](/Friends/ValPhillips/)'s request for

    1.  transfer of membership from Mountain View Meeting

    2.  Gardner Worship Group coming under the care of Colorado Springs
        Meeting.

    Recommendations: [Val Phillips](/Friends/ValPhillips/)' membership
    transfer request should be approved. Her second request on behalf of
    Gardner Worship Group is taken under advisement pending input from
    June Meeting for Worship for Business to determine what questions
    and comments we should convey to [Val](/Friends/ValPhillips/) on
    behalf of the Meeting. (M&O Clerk has contacted
    [Val](/Friends/ValPhillips/) on these matters, and she has been
    asked to attend the June M&O meeting.)

There being no further business before the committee we ended in
spiritual silence and in appreciation for our consultation with
[Carlton](/Friends/CarltonGamer/) and [Genie](/Friends/GenieDurland/).
