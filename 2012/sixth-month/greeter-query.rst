Is it the will of the meeting that we have a greeter available from 9:50am-10:10am each Sunday? In other meetings I've visited, the greeter does some, or all, of the following:
--welcome people
--show friends the nametag area (where we may have disposable nametages for newcomers and pre-made nametags for regulars)
--make available various forms of info about us/Quakerism (a laminated one-page "about us" sheet could give new attenders something to read without being self conscious about crinkling pages)
--provide the welcome packet that COS Friends have assembled
 
Which of these would friends like our greeter to do? Are there other things Friends would like the greeter to do?
 
If Friends would like there to be one person in charge of coordinating greeters/making a schedule of who will be a greeter on which days, I would be willing to do this starting in July.
 
In the Light,
 
Maria
