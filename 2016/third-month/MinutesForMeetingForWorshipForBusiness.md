APPENDICES

### Ministry and Oversight Committee Minutes, March 15, 2016

Present were [Carlton Gamer][CarltonGamer], [Jeremy Nelson][JeremyNelson] and 
[Ann Grant Martin][AnnGrantMartin] - Clerk

We began about 11:00 at [Carlton's][CarltonGamer] home. Future meetings will 
be at [Carlton's][CarltonGamer] home.

Our meeting dealt primarily with health concerns. One of us is facing serious medical matters. 
Ministry and Oversight committee members created a "Circle of Light" around our beloved 
Friend. 

We reviewed the February Minutes and noted Soup and Sharing will be scheduled soon at the 
home of [Lisa Lister][LisaLiser] and [Phil Friesen][PhilFriesen]. The topic can 
be "Spoken Ministry." We discussed the Friends who have recently lost loved ones.

We recommend that Meeting for Business consider having a "Show and Tell" session on 
designated Second Days.

We recommend that a "Circle of Light" be convened for Friends experiencing a 
life crisis.

Members of M&O will continue to make Friendly Calls to members and regular 
attenders. We will work toward creating a document that describes the work 
of various committees.

M&O’s next meeting will be April 5, 2015 at 11:00 at [Carlton's][CarltonGamer]. 

In the Light,                          

[Ann Grant Martin][AnnGrantMartin], Clerk

### Finance Committee Meeting Minutes

Third Month, 10th day, 2016 

Present: [Sarah Callbeck][SarahCallbeck] (Bookkeeper, Treasurer, & Clerk) and 
[Lisa Lister][LisaLister] (Recorder).  [John Robey][JohnRobey] was unable 
to attend.

The meeting was held at the meetinghouse.

We opened with silence.

We carefully reviewed all financial reports for the period ending 2-29-2016 and 
found all to be in good order:

*   Cash Flow Report 

*   Ent Savings Detail Update

*   Current Month Planning of Available Funds

Our "budget billing" utility payment will be up for review by Colorado Springs 
Utilities soon.  

Right now we pay a set $144 a month year-round.  It is possible (perhaps even 
likely) that the monthly amount may go down slightly.  This is likely due to 
our warm winter.

MINUTE REQUESTED

We received a letter from Friends Fiduciary asking us to update their agreement 
with us (and all of their other clients).  This is rather perfunctory (it does 
not change our investment with them), but they are asking us for a minute.  
They are simply doing their due diligence to make sure their investors 
understand recent changes.)  We need a minute authorizing the Meeting to adopt the 
revised "Custody and Investment Agreement" as outlined in their letter dated 
12th month, 9th day, 2015.  [Sarah][SarahCallbeck] will be able to explain 
more fully in business meeting.

We then discussed the mortgage application to the FGC Meeting House Fund, which is due at 
the end of April.  [Sarah][SarahCallbeck] is very busy, but will make sure it is 
submitted on time.

We closed in silence.
