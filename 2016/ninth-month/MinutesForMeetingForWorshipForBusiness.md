## Appendix B
__A Minute in Support of Quaker Participation in the SOA-WATCH Nonviolent Direct Action at the U.S.-Mexico Border__

The Colorado Springs Friends Meeting joins in and supports the efforts of Quakers who will gather at the 
U.S.-Mexico border at Nogales on October 7-10, 2016 to protest against racism, xenophobia, criminalization of 
refugees and migration and U.S. militarization.

(The School of the Americas (SOA) Watch is held annually at Ft. Benning, GA where the U.S. military trains 
foreign security forces to use repressive force against Latin Americans)

## Appendix C
Hello Colorado Springs Quaker Meeting, 

As you may know, I am active with Citizens' Climate Lobby (CCL). CCL is a volunteer-driven, 
non-partisan organization working with all 535 members of Congress to address climate change. CCL's 
work features a focus on building relationships, interacting with grace and respect, truly listening, 
and simplicity of focus. I have been active for several years with a South Dakota chapter. A Colorado 
Springs chapter is in progress. Meanwhile, anyone interested in more information can go to [www.citizensclimatelobby.org](http://www.citizensclimatelobby.org). 

As part of our effort, we are asking influential community leaders like you to consider lending your voice to this issue. As a simple 
first step, we would like to ask that you please consider signing our Community Leader's Letter to Congress, attached. You can 
either do this as an individual (i.e. [Name, Title]), or, if possible, on behalf of the Colorado Springs Quaker Meeting. 

Once you have had a chance to review the letter, please let me know if you are willing to support our effort. If you are, 
I'll send an electronic request for you to sign - it would greatly help my fellow volunteers and me as we continue to 
engage our members of Congress! 

Thanks very much for your consideration! I'm very happy to discuss any questions or concerns. I can be contacted at 
605-484-4090 or Cromwell.eb@protonmail.com. 

Respectfully, 
Barbara Cromwell 

__A Few Details about Carbon Fee and Dividend__
 
A climate solution that's simple, fair, and market-friendly 

*   Place a fee on fossil fuels at the source (mine, well or port) 
*   Return 100% of the revenue to U.S. households 
*   Apply a border adjustment to discourage businesses from relocating to where they can emit more CO2 
    and to encourage other nations to adopt an equivalent price on carbon 

Stabilize the Climate and Boost the Economy 

*   Cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% in 20 years 
*   Create 2.8 million jobs, boost our GDP and save 200,000 lives
