**State of the Meeting**

Colorado Springs Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends

May 1, 2016

The Colorado Springs Religious Society of Friends continues to prosper
in the search for the Truth. After more than 50 years as a Meeting, we
are celebrating our third year in residence at our Meeting House.
Fortunately the serious flooding problem in our basement in the Spring
was solved with the installation of a sump pump and outside mitigation.

We remain of modest size but continue to slowly grow and contribute to
the greater Quaker and Peace communities.

Presently we have 16 members, about 10 regular attenders and 4 junior
members. We are heartened that the number of visitors has increased, a
few of whom have become regular attenders.

Children and Young Friends are infrequent attenders. However, we have a
well stocked first Day School room with new furniture and rug. Teachers
are ready to teach. We look forward to the time when we have a more
vigorous First Day School program.

Our adult Religious Education program read *The Essential Elias Hicks*
and were enriched by the discussion about Elias and Quaker history. In
addition, an occasional book group continues to focus on reading and
discussing Quaker fiction. The Meeting has the tradition of gathering
for an annual "Soup & Sharing" worship-sharing time. This year we
focused on "Spoken Ministry" which was spiritually enriching.

We held a Quaker Quest session in September (under the auspices of
Friends General Conference) which was well supported by our members and
attenders. This helped us think about our Meeting in an intentional way,
especially how to attract new members. A follow up Threshing Session was
held in November.

Since we have a building to offer non-profit and other groups we are
beginning to notice an increase in our meetinghouse's use. Several of
the groups that use our space include a 12 step group, various language
classes, a Buddhist book group, practices for Bill Durland's plays, and
writing workshops. The Coloradoans Against the Death Penalty held an
open house in December. The Heart Warrior Project for veterans recently
completed a series of workshops.

We continue to benefit from the many talents and contributions of
Friends. We look forward to continued growth and Spiritual light in the
coming year.

In the Light, Ann Grant Martin, Clerk of Ministry and Oversight

Lisa Lister, Clerk of the Colorado Springs Monthly Meeting

Colorado Springs Friends Meeting

Attn: Ministry & Oversight

950 East Cimarron Street

Colorado Springs, CO

Dear Ann,

I would like to thank you, Carlton, Linda, Peter, and Lisa for forming a
Clearness committee and for meeting with me today.

I am writing to request that the Meeting consider me for full
membership. While I am happy merely to attend, I feel that membership
will provide the type of spiritual grounding needed for my on-going
spiritual development.

I feel blessed and very fortunate in having found spiritual fellowship
and kindred minds within the Colorado Springs Religious Society of
Friends. The members and attenders here are such good people that I
rejoice to be included among you.

I realize I may yet have more to learn about Friends (Quakers) and
Quakerism; and look forward to receiving gentle guidance and
instruction, as needed.

Should you, the Committee, or the Membership have any questions
regarding my character, history, or motives, please do not hesitate to
contact me (though I rather expect the Quaker way will be to *go inside*
rather than asking outward questions.)

Thank you for considering my request; and Thank You for teaching me yet
more about the inner Light and the way(s) of the Sacred Spirit.

Blessings & Love to you each and all.

John

## APPENDIX C

Minute of Support for Planned Parenthood

Planned Parenthood has recently come under extreme criticism from
politicians because of allegations that have now been proven false. The
current political move to defund Planned Parenthood would be disastrous.
It would make it impossible for millions of Americans to obtain
preventive services like cancer screening and family planning. There
would be almost no impact on abortion services.

Reproductive rights and health care are lawful human rights that allow
individuals to control their fertility and improve their health. Family
planning is the most effective way to avoid unplanned pregnancies and
therefore the need for abortion.

Colorado Springs Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends
recognizes the importance of Planned Parenthood clinics to millions of
men and women in the country. We support these clinics throughout the US
and recognize the staff members for the important services they provide.
Our local Colorado Springs clinic has been the target of violence, and
we stand with them in solidarity as they and our community heals.

In addition to voicing our support of Planned Parenthood, we ask
ourselves as members and attenders to consider taking the following
actions:

-   Write Letters to the Editor and OpEds supporting reproductive health
    and rights in general and specifically supporting Planned Parenthood

-   Write to your legislators supporting reproductive health and rights
    in general and specifically supporting Planned Parenthood

-   Volunteer to escort patients or help in other needed ways at a
    Planned Parenthood clinic

-   Donate financial support to local Planned Parenthood clinics
