A.  **Epistle from Intermountain Yearly Meeting, 2016**

To Friends Everywhere:

Greetings from Intermountain Yearly Meeting Friends. IMYM gathered once
again, around 300 strong, June 6-12, 2016 at Ghost Ranch, New Mexico.
The vast geographic scope of IMYM means that connections and fellowship
among Friends of the intermountain west has enormous significance. One
Friend observed that when Young Friends arrive and see each other for
the first time in a year, they literally leap into one anotherâ€™s arms.
Most adult Friends are somewhat less demonstrative but that does not
mean they are less enthusiastic about renewing bonds with one another.
We had visitors from FGC, AFSC, FCNL, Right Sharing of World Resources
and Earlham School of Religion, as well as Mexico, El Salvador and a
variety of Monthly Meetings from other parts of the country.

In attendance were both young and old; the youngest being one year old
and among our elders, 91-year-old Marian Hoge, an early founder of our
Yearly Meeting. And yet our love and regard for one another go beyond
our individual ties. We are a true Yearly Meeting of the Religious
Society of Friends in our attention to the important business that comes
before us each year and to the theme we have chosen and the Keynote
presentation we receive about that theme.

Callid Keefe-Perry, Quaker minister from Fresh Pond Monthly Meeting in
Massachusetts spoke to us on Nurturing Spiritual Gifts and Ministry in
our Meetings. "SIPAG" was his acronym for the definition of Ministry.
SI-PA-GA means;

Sustained-Intention

Prayerful-Attention

Guided-Action

He suggested that in our spiritual endeavors we -alive in the dashes." He
came before us with immense creativity and originality, presenting his
message with humor and startling metaphors. He engaged us with his
words, moving us toward one another with participatory exercises, and
sending us back to our Monthly Meetings with an inspired definition of
our purpose in community and in worship for the conduct of our business:
a meeting is "a community gathering of individuals willing to enter into
a committed relationship with one another and with God."

Early days programming reflected the ways in which that commitment
becomes manifest in our locales and in our world. Programs included
stewardship in finance, Upcycling, Peru (site of this year's FWCC
Section of the Americas Conference), a play using historic Quaker
figures in dialogue with one another, immigration, the creation of
Soul-collages and their interpretation, and other topics. Of particular
interest was the Pay as Led program of New England Yearly Meeting
presented in a workshop. These programs added to our commitment to
action and witness, as did the many informal conversations during meals
and the quiet, reflective time in worship sharing on the vast Ghost
Ranch landscape.

As part of our business, we considered several Minutes, one supporting a
U.N. resolution proposing a Humanitarian Pledge for the Prohibition and
Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. The economies of the four states that
compose IMYM "Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona"  are dependent to
an alarming extent on the nuclear weapons industry. Another Minute was
proposed on supporting continued federal funding for Planned Parenthood
health care services. We heard an inspiring report on Mountain Friends
Camp, presented by several of the young Friends who have experienced the
camp. Mountain Friends Camp is a Yearly Meeting initiative with growing
significance to our youth and future growth. We had some heavy decisions
to undertake for future yearly meetings, that we addressed as part of
"our committed relationship with one another" and to witness in the
world.

Our Senior Young Friends have been deeply concerned about today's issues
of gender and sexual equality. They were led to organize an educational
listening session called "Sharing Our Truth." Friends of all ages
attended as Young Friends found a safe place to share their experiences
about and within the LGBTQ community. Friends spoke as led across a wide
spectrum of identities and ages providing a powerful witness that we
hope will be continued in Monthly Meetings and beyond.

Singing introduced several of our business sessions, and one evening
there was a well-attended sing-along and campfire with marshmallows!
Although Ghost Ranch cut staffing for the cantina, Friends showed
entrepreneurial initiative and brought ice cream and snacks to sell at
the cantina to support Mountain Friends Camp. The ages didn't matter, as
the enthusiastic community formed as naturally as breathing. And, of
course, the Friday night dance powered by our own IMYM contra dance
band. As always, Yearly Meeting social time was capped off by the annual
Creativity Night on Saturday night. Skits, poetry reading, musical
offerings and much more demonstrated our abundance of creativity and
brought us together in laughter and applause.

Worship sharing groups met for four mornings as well as Senior Young
Friends-led intergenerational worship sharing groups after lunch daily.
Friends reported these to create meaningful connections among the IMYM
community. Departed Friends were remembered and celebrated in a Meeting
for the reading of Memorial Minutes.

Emotions are running high concerning the possibility of leaving Ghost
Ranch due to a variety of considerations. Many of us have become very
attached to the beautiful natural landscape, but we recognize that a
yearly meeting is much more than it's setting. We recognized that our
Meetings for Worship for Business and our spiritual fellowship and
mutual care are our reality as a Yearly Meeting and we trust the Spirit
to lead us through these decisions to come down in the place just
right, in the words of a favorite old song.

With love and Light,

Sarah Keeney, Presiding Clerk

Intermountain Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends
